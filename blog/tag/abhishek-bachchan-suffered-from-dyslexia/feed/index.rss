<p>Dyslexia
has nothing to do with mental retardation, lack of intelligence or
brain damage.  It isn’t a disease as well. It’s just that
children with dyslexia find it difficult to read. The simple solution
to this is the use of blue or yellow filter glasses in order to help
deal with the visual problems.</p>



<p>
Here are a few common traits
of dyslexia 
</p>



<ol><li>

	<strong>Poor self-esteem</strong>
	– Uses compensatory strategies to hide weaknesses. Reading and
	testing sparks emotions and frustrations. 
	
	</li><li>

	<strong>Day Dreamer</strong>
	– Day dreams often and seems to lose track of time or get zoned
	out easily
	</li><li>

	<strong>Attention deficit</strong>
	– Cannot concentrate and gets distracted easily 
	
	</li><li>

	<strong>High IQ</strong>
	– Not necessarily does well in academics but high IQ and ability
	to score well in oral as that against written
	</li><li>

	<strong>Confused </strong>–
	Reading, writing, letters, spellings and verbal explanations tend to
	confuse a lot.
	</li><li>

	<strong>Writing Difficulties</strong>
	– Cannot copy or write properly and holds the pencil in an unusual
	manner. 
	
	</li><li>

	 <strong>Artist </strong>–
	Should possess talent around sports, music, drama, mechanics,
	building or engineering.
	</li><li>

	<strong>Sequence Confusion</strong>
	– A problem with remembering sequence of things 
	
	</li><li>

	<strong>Word Processing Issues</strong>
	– Problem around seeing differences and similarities between words
	and letters. 
	
	</li><li>

	<strong>Foreign language –
	</strong>Difficulty
	learning foreign language.
</li></ol>



<p>The symptoms include inability to ready by kindergarten or first grade but kids with dyslexia find it difficult to grasp even the basics of reading.  They are also at a high risk of Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ADHD (opens in a new tab)">ADHD</a>).</p>
