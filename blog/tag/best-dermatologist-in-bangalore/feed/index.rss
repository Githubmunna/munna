<p>Also
known as the silent killer, diabetes can do a lot of damage if you do
not manage to understand the early signs of it. Type 2 diabetes is a
very common form of diabetes and is a result of lack of exercise and
obesity. 
</p>



<p>Many
a times your skin shows you the symptoms and it is preventable if you
exercise and maintain normal weight. As per reports around 90% of
cases of diabetes are apparently preventable if measures are taken on
time. Furthermore, if diabetes type 2 is left untreated then it could
also lead to life threatening health complications like heart attack,
kidney failure and strokes. 
</p>

<p>So,
why are the warning signs not taken seriously, is one question that
haunts many. The reason could be as simple as not taking them as
signs but simple health issues that could fade away with time or just
taking notice and delaying checkup till it’s forgotten. 
</p>



<p>Well,
let us run down some of the signs that could help you alert around
type 2 diabetes. 
</p>



<ol><li>

	 <strong>Frequent Washroom trips</strong>
	– high blood sugar means kidneys work hard to remove the excess
	sugar form the blood and hence it is considered to be an alarm for
	diabetes if one has to frequently wake up to go to pee. 
	
	</li><li>

	<strong>Frequent urge to drink
	water</strong> – Due to frequent urination, even the urge to drink
	water increases due to dehydration
	</li><li>

	Fatigue – The energy levels
	of type 2 diabetes people are low due to deficiency of sugar through
	the blood stream to the body cells. 
	
	</li><li>

	<strong>Hunger pangs</strong> – Due
	to lack of energy people suffering from type 2 diabetes tend to feel
	hungry on a constant basis even if they’d have eaten recently
	enough
	</li><li>

	<strong>Blurry Vision </strong>– At
	times high sugar could damage vision and result into blurred vision
	in one or both the eyes
	</li><li>

	<strong>Yeast Infections </strong>–
	Excess sugar in body could lead to yeast infection. The affected
	areas could get red, sore or itchy. 
	
</li></ol>



<ol><li>

	<strong>Tingling and Numbness</strong>
	– Due to rise in sugar levels people with this condition could
	experience tingling and numbess in their hands and feet. Known as
	neuropathy this condition has chances of worsening with time and
	hence early intervention is required.
</li></ol>



<ol><li>

	<strong>Skin Darkening</strong> – For
	people suffering from diabetes, dark, velvety and soft patches
	appear on skin anywhere around the armpits, groin or neck. 
	
</li></ol>



<p> Perhaps, its not that difficult to be alarmed if we only pay attention at the signs. Early intervention could help deal with diabetes in a better way and also keep other life threatening conditions at bay.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A
recent study has revealed that people who have to suffer from
economic hardships for even as less as 4 years are prone to ageing
faster as compared to their peers who are economically stable.  The
researchers at the Department of Public health at the Copenhagen
University of Denmark carried out a study to compare economically
well to do, late middle aged adults and adults experiencing financial
issues. 
</p>



<p>The
study involved over 5575 adults in their late middle ages with a
benchmark hardship of 60% less than that of the national average over
22 years period. Out of these 5575, 18% were having financial
hardship during the period of 1987-2008. Lead by Rikki Lund, the team
studied and analyzed cognitive as well as physical functions like
chair rise, jump, balance, grip and strength. 
</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Finances-and-Aging-–-The-Connection.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1218" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Finances-and-Aging-–-The-Connection.jpg 520w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Finances-and-Aging-–-The-Connection-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></figure>



<p>The
study found that people who experienced poverty over 4 years
performed less as compared to people of the same age who were living
without any financial problems. The findings suggest that the absence
of economic problems protects from aging faster while the opposite
not only increases ageing but also the blood CRP levels. 
</p>



<p>When
people are less capable of doing physical activities earlier than
then the others of the same age it is called accelerated aging. It
could be a result of higher inflammatory markers like C-reactive
protein (CRP) and IL-6 or poor cognitive functioning. 
</p>



<p>In
the Western society, aging population means more healthcare costs and
hence healthy ageing is promoted.  The study has results that match
the earlier studies with did show an inverse connection between
economic difficulties and physical abilities besides cognitive
difficulties that have been already reported. 
</p>



<p>Having said that, there is one story that has a different story to tell. It states that a human’s perception about economic hardships is more significant indicator and not their real financial condition.  The study does come with a few limitations though, which include factors like not considering data of various societies, not considering any other potential confounding factors responsible or even diseases and conditions that are not a result of poverty but still could affect longevity and speed ageing.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Sunscreens are a common household commodity today in India. With temperatures in India soaring across its length and breadth during summers and generally across the year in most of the regions, sunscreen is generally used by many of us for protection against the scorching sun.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But, like every coin has two sides to it, even sunscreens come with their share of pros and cons. So, let us run down the brighter side of the product and the flip side as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SUNSCREEN USES</strong><br />
They help protect the skin from sun, control aging and prevent sunburns. They also decrease the risk of cancers and reactions caused due to certain medications. The protective layer formed with sunscreens absorbs or reflects the radiations and does not allow them to penetrate deep inside the skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though, for optimum effect sunscreens need to be applied properly. In general, 30 grams of cream is enough for covering the entire body. The cream needs to be applied 30 minutes before exposure to sun and needs to be reapplied every 2 hours. Sunscreens can used for people of 1 year and above and is not recommended for infants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SUNSCREEN SIDE EFFECTS</strong><br />
<em>Vitamin D Deficiency</em> &#8211; A recent study has found that use of sunscreens on a regular basis leads to deficiency of vitamin D. The people who use highly protective sunscreens are more liable to develop deficiency of vitamin D. Already, people spend most of their time indoors than outdoors and now the sunscreen when outdoors, so its about zeros the <a title="Vitamin D" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D" target="_blank">Vitamin D</a> availability to the body almost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, Sunscreens can also cause side effects such as redness of skin, skin irritation and also increase the risk of breast cancer with one of its chemicals does effect the blood estrogen levels. It can also cause red spots or red itchy rashes on skin besides eye irritation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having said that, it does not mean that we stop using sunscreen. But, moderate exposures to sun is a good idea while using sun screens to protect skin from harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun that may cause skin cancer.</p>
