<p>A
new study revealed exactly how much fiber is required for keeping the
chronic conditions as well as premature mortality at bay.  The
objective of the study is to set the guideline for consumption of
fiber besides bringing to light information around the carbs
responsible for protection against non-communicable diseases as well
as curb weight gain. 
</p>



<p>The
author of the study namely Professor Jim Mann, of Otago University
New Zealand and the author of the paper Andrew Reynolds is a
postdoctoral research fellow at Otago’s Dunedin School of Medicine.

</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-Much-Fiber-Intake-For-Prevention-Of-Diseases.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1222" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-Much-Fiber-Intake-For-Prevention-Of-Diseases.jpg 678w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-Much-Fiber-Intake-For-Prevention-Of-Diseases-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></figure>



<p>The
study was carried out by Reynolds and colleagues by examination of a
data that had 185 observational studies that included 135 million
person-years besides 58 clinical trials that involved the
participation of 4600 people.  The study analysis was carried across
40 years. 
</p>



<p>As
per prof. Mann, the motivation behind this study was analysis of
previous reviews and meta-analysis.  The scientists studied chronic
condition incidences as well as premature deaths resulting from them.
 The conditions included cardiovascular diseases, stroke, colon
cancer, type 2 diabetes, cancers such as esophageal cancer,
endometrial cancer, prostate cancer to name a few. 
</p>



<p>The
results of the study revealed that people who consume more fiber
daily are      15-30% less prone to premature deaths or any of the
aforementioned conditions. It also determined that daily consumption
of 25 -29 gms of fibre is good for health. Though consumption of more
than 29 gms of fibre could be even more beneficial. 
</p>



<p>Having
said that, the authors cleared that the study did not present any
side effects of fibre consumption but too much fibre could also be
harmful particularly for people with iron and mineral deficiencies.
Even consumption of whole grains in excess can lead to iron
deficiency as per researchers. 
</p>



<p>Lastly,
the study also found that consumption of high amount of fibre results
does relate to less weight and cholesterol levels. 
</p>



<p> Prof. Mann says “ Health benefits of fiber are supported by over 100 years of research into its chemistry, physical properties, physiology and effects on metabolism.</p>

<p>A
recent study by scientists reveals about regions of the Human DNA and
their association with left handedness. These regions are connected
to the brains language related features. An earlier study around
handedness had revealed that genes were responsible for 25% of it but
the type or name of the genes was unknown. 
</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Genetic-Components-Related-To-Left-Handedness.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1206" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Genetic-Components-Related-To-Left-Handedness.jpg 685w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Genetic-Components-Related-To-Left-Handedness-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" /></figure>



<p>In
India and across the world there were has been a lot of stigma and
taboo around being left handed. But, today rarely anyone is of the
belief or even discriminates between left and right handed people. 
</p>



<p>10%
of the population in the world is known to be left handed and also
includes many well-known individuals like Alert Einstein and Leonardo
da Vinci amongst them.  
</p>



<p>The
recent study was published in the journal ‘Brain’ and involved
the participation of 40,000 people including 38000 left handed ones.
After doing the genetic analysis, the researchers found that it was
the DNA regions that linked to left handedness strongly.  
</p>



<p>As
per the researchers the three regions are inside or are responsible
for protein code of brain development and patterning.  Proteins play
a significant role in making microtubules which are scaffolding like
building block and are responsible for guiding cell construction. 
</p>



<p>Microtubules
are made up of long chained molecules making up the physical
structure of the cells throughout the body also known as cytoskeleton
and have the ability to respond to cell singals by quickly assembling
and disassembling. 
</p>



<p>The
scientists did study brain scan details of 9000 participants after
analyzing their DNA samples.  The findings indicate that in left
handed people right and left side for brain that deals with language
coordinate in a better way compared to right handed ones. These
findings thus pave the path for getting deeper into finding if left
handed people are better in tasks that involve verbal communication
compared to the right handed ones. 
</p>



<p>Well, as per Gwenaelle Dououad, associate professor at the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging that it was apparently for the first time that they had been able to establish that in humans the handedness is linked to cytoskeletal differences in the brain.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently Bollywood celebrity Irfan Khan is known to be diagnosed by Neuroendocrine Tumor. In order to restrain his fans and people in general from any kind of speculation he even went on to clarify that neuro does not always mean about the brain. He had to do that post rumors of he suffering from brain tumor surfaced across the social media. Well, as he is out of the country right now and is getting treated, best wishes of all the country are with him. Well, for those who are unaware about neuroendocrine tumor here’s a rundown this condition.</p>
<p>Neuroendocrine tumor or NET is a tumor which does not generally show any major symptoms as it grows slowly. Once the tumor grows or if it releases hormones while it is functional is when symptoms surface.<br />
Types of Endocrine tumors include pancreatic endocrine tumor, gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors and lung neuroendocrine tumors.</p>
<p>Pancreatic Neuro Endocrine Tumors – This is a rare kind of tumor. The symptoms of this cancer are subject to the hormones released by it. The symptoms generally include the following</p>
<ol>
<li>Stomach Ulcers</li>
<li>Heart burn</li>
<li>Jaundice</li>
<li>Low or high blood Sugar levels</li>
<li>Blood clots</li>
<li>Patches of red itchy and painful skin</li>
<li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
</ol>
<p>When the gastrin in body increases excessively it causes Zollinger Ellison syndrome further increasing the quantity of stomach acid ultimately causing small intestine or stomach ulcers. The symptoms include</p>
<ol>
<li>Severe Diarrhea</li>
<li>Heartburn</li>
<li>Abdominal Pain</li>
<li>Pain in abdomen</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>Blood vomits</li>
<li>Weight loss</li>
</ol>
<p>When the level of cortisol increases highly inside the body it causes cushing syndrome. When too much Adrenocorticotrpic hormone is released it leads to lung NETs which leads to adrenal glands making too much cortisol. The symptoms are as follows –</p>
<ol>
<li>Muscle weakness</li>
<li>Increase in hair growth on body and face</li>
<li>High blood sugar</li>
<li>Weight gain</li>
<li>Fat build up above the collar bone below the shoulders</li>
<li>Mood swing and behavioral changes</li>
<li>Purple lines on skin</li>
</ol>
<p>Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors – This tumor develops in any part of the gastrointestinal tract besides large and small intestine. The symptoms are as follows –</p>
<ol>
<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Anemia with fatigue</li>
<li>Weight loss</li>
<li>Constipation or intestine blockage</li>
<li>Blood in stool or rectal bleeding</li>
<li>Heartburn or indigestion</li>
<li>Abdominal/ rectal pain or discomfort</li>
</ol>
<p>Lung Neuroendocrine tumors &#8211; This tumor develops in the bronchi. Symptoms include</p>
<ol>
<li>Never ceasing cough</li>
<li>Blood in cough</li>
<li>Difficulty Breathing</li>
<li>Pneumonia</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Skin flushing, wheezing and diarrhea (Carcinoid Syndrome)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Vagus Nerve Stimulation or VNS</strong> has already got a green signal from the Food and Drug Administration of USA for conditions like epilepsy and depression but the latest reports confirm its utilization in rehabilitation of the limb for stroke patients. Many of us are aware of the fact that over 80% of people who’ve recently got a stroke find significant difficulty or weakness on one side of their body. With Paralysis or Hemiparesis, there is high possibility that the patients have to live with it for the rest of their lives. It has also be observed that oral drugs have not been so effective in reducing the impairments. This is when VNS technology experiments were carried out on patients with significant arm weakness post stroke.</p>
<p>The test include 20 patients randomly divided into two groups and observed over a period of six weeks in Glasgow, Scotland. One group was kept entirely under rehabilitation while the other was provided VNS treatment alongside rehabilitation.</p>
<p>VNS treatment for stroke patient involves implanting a device surgically below the collar bone of the patient. It does the task of delivering stimulation to the vagus nerve.As per the experimental data available, VNS activates structures in the brain stem, thus causing a release of neurotransmitters like norepinephrine or acetylcholine. This temporary activation of the neurotransmitters in turn helps the brain to be more receptive with the physical therapy exercises during<a title="Physiotherapist in Bangalore" href="http://hospital.rrmch.org/department/physiotherapy/" target="_blank"> physiotherapy</a> rehabilitation sessions.</p>
<p>The results where encouraging because the latter group that was provided the VNS treatment seemed to show an average 9% improvement. Individual variation did persist but overall it proved to be effective as it improved the motion and strength of their stroke affected limb. Thus, the results of VNS for limb rehabilitation of stroke patients seems to be quite promising and has also received a positive response from the doctors as well. It looks like, the coming times will definitely shed light on its full fledged utilization in limb rehabilitation of stroke patients.<br />
None the less, it is a ray of hope in the direction of improvement of quality of life of the stroke patients who live through the fear of arm weakness and dependency for their lifetime.</p>
