<p>We
all know that board games are a fun way to be engaged in play in
doors particularly for kids. But, here’s some news. A new study
carried out by the Researchers at Edinburgh university of United
Kingdom reveals that board games could actually help Older Adults
avert off their cognitive decline. The paper was authored by Drew
Altschul of School of philosophy, Pscychology and Language sciences
in association with Professor Deary, director of Edinburgh Lothian
Birth Cohorts and published in the Journals of Gerontology. 
</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Board-Games.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1243" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Board-Games.jpg 1000w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Board-Games-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Board-Games-768x598.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /><figcaption>FBHDTJ Still-life selection of board games (Monopoly, Chess, Cluedo, Scrabble) with playing cards and gambling chips</figcaption></figure>



<p>The
study was carried out on 1091 subjects born in the year 1936 for
assessment of their mental and cognitive capabilities.  The
researchers did the evaluation for cognitive functioning across ages
11, 70, 73, 79 with the help of 14 different standard cognitive
tests.</p>



<p>The
study included asking questions to participants in the age group of
70 and 76 about how many times across the week they indulged in board
games like bingo, chess, crosswords, cards, bingo and more .  The
researchers also took into account confounding factors like
education, early life cognitive function, activity levels, sex and
health issues to name a few, as a part of their analysis. 
</p>



<p>The
results unleashed that the people who were more into board games in
their later year’s post 70’s were better off maintaining their
cognitive functioning. Particularly those older adults who indulged
in analog games post 70’s showed relative less decline in cognitive
abilities across 11 and 70 years and also between the age of 70 and
79. 
</p>



<p>Altschul,
one of the study leads says “ these latest findings add to evidence
that being more engaged in activities during the life course might be
associated with better thinking skills in later life”. 
</p>



<p>While coauthor thinks that there is a possibility that there is an interpretation of results as push to start playing board games and avoid cognitive decline.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">A study published in the journal of Neurophysiology shows that arm exercises helps stroke patients improve their walking ability even weeks and months after the occurrence of stroke. The researchers at the University of British Columbia, Canada did the study on a group of adults who were prone to stroke in the period of 7 months and 17 years before the commencement of the study.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Arm-Exercise-Help-Regain-Walking-Ability-in-Stroke-Patients-1-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-793 size-medium" src="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Arm-Exercise-Help-Regain-Walking-Ability-in-Stroke-Patients-1-300x200.jpg" alt="Arm Exercise Help Regain Walking Ability in Stroke Patients" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Arm-Exercise-Help-Regain-Walking-Ability-in-Stroke-Patients-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Arm-Exercise-Help-Regain-Walking-Ability-in-Stroke-Patients-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Arm-Exercise-Help-Regain-Walking-Ability-in-Stroke-Patients-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>A training session was organized and the physical abilities of the volunteers was measured before and after the training which included a six minute walk daily to measure the distance covered in that time, 10 meter walk with a timer on to find out how fast a person can cover the distance and finally again another timer based activity which included getting up from a seated position, walking 10 meters and coming back the same distance.</p>
<p>The researchers also checked the stretch reflexes, electrical activity in muscles in wrists and lower legs through walking and cycling tests.</p>
<p>The researchers observed that the participants show good improvement in their performance particularly in the time up and go test. There was no notable improvement in grip strength of participants but the participants showed less tightness in muscles after their cycling trial.</p>
<p>Even their nerve activity levels showed improvement during the arm cycling task. As per the researchers, it also activated inter-limb networks and contributed to rhythmic walking coordination. In short, the arm nerved activated and helped in improving the spinal chords functioning in areas affected by stroke like legs.</p>
<p>The researchers added that these results are a positive sign about improvements in walking ability even afters years of having a stroke. The researchers did say that walking improvement could not be compared to other training modalities, arm training did play a significant role in human locomotion rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The department of<strong><a title="Best physiotherapist in Bangalore" href="http://hospital.rrmch.org/department/physiotherapy/" target="_blank"> physiotherapy</a></strong> was established in 2003 at <strong><a title="Best Medical Colleges in Bangalore" href="http://www.rrmch.org/" target="_blank">RajaRajeswari Medical College and Hospital</a></strong> to cater to the preventive, creative, therapeutic and rehabilitation needs of the rural people need was felt to impart the much needed physiotherapy vocational and rehabilitation training programme.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">With pollution clogging up the air and chemicals degrading the quality of vegetables and greens, increased stress levels due to constant workloads, early age strokes, accidents while commuting, lifestyle diseases like obesity and more are taking a toll on people. Rehabilitation is slowly and steadily gaining importance in the healthcare sector. These days most of the multi-specialty hospitals have a rehabilitation centre with qualified Physiotherapists for treatment and therapy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Physiotherapy-Career-In-India-1-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-390 aligncenter" src="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Physiotherapy-Career-In-India-1-1.jpg" alt="Physiotherapy Colleges in Bangalore" width="569" height="494" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Experts are already forecasting the immense possibilities for expansion and growth of Physiotherapy. The career is definitely a promising one, considering the fact that even people have realized the potential of physiotherapy in significantly improving quality of life by working on body mobilization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But, before you decide to take your plunge into this field which for sure offers total work satisfaction and is miles away from being monotonous in nature, you need to sit down and think about flip-side of the coin. You need to be aware that this career involves working with people of all ages and mental as well as physical disabilities or challenges. From kids to elderly, mentally challenged to accident victims, general populace to criminals, anyone for that matter could be your patient. Dealing with all kinds of people also means dealing with their tempers. So, primarily you need to have loads of patience and ability to keep calm during stressed times. It is a bit of physical work also because you need to demonstrate the exercises or body moves to the patients. This could be physically draining at times as well. So, take your decision about pursuing the career only after contemplating on these facts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After giving it a thought, if you still feel passionate about pursuing the career, go ahead. Depending upon your interest you may either go for a Bachelors in Physiotherapy, Masters in Physiotherapy or you many are interested in doing research of taking up teaching as a profession. A doctorate is always advisable. In the US and UK, there is a high demand for Physiotherapists compared to India where the sun seems to be shining on this profession though its only into its initial growth phase. So, taking up a doctorate or a specialization in the field in an overseas university definitely would open doors to umpteen opportunities overseas for this profession. Even the payscale oversees is significantly high compared to India.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In India as a <a title="Physiotherapist in Bangalore" href="http://hospital.rrmch.org/department/physiotherapy/" target="_blank">physiotherapist</a> you may get to work in private hospitals, rehabilitation centres, defence establishments, sports and fitness centres, as private consultant to corporates, private practice at your own clinic or with the government hospitals, old age home, mental healthcare centres and more. The work timings are generally good and flexible to an extent. The good part is this profession does not require working during odd hours of the night, etc. So, you get ample time to spend with your family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, <a title="Physiotherapy Colleges in Bangalore" href="http://college.rrmch.org/department/physiotherapy/" target="_blank">Physiotherapy</a> is a challenging field but it is interesting and self satisfying as well. If it interests you a lot and you want to work for serving people and augmenting their health and fitness levels, then this profession is the right choice for you.</p>
