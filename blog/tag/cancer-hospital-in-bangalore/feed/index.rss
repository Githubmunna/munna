<p><strong>Breast cancer</strong> is one of the most common cancers amongst women in India and worldwide. A recent study about women who lost weight at 50 and maintained a healthy weight thereon showed a decreased risk of breast cancer as compared to women with more weight.  This study is therefore a way to help women work around prevention of cancer.  </p>

<p>The
study is published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
In USA over two third of the adult women are overweight or obese. The
study was carried out by the researchers at the American Cancer
Society, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health using the Pooling
Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer (DCPP) in order to
determine the connection between sustained loss of weight after
menopause or later adulthood and the risk of breast cancer.</p>



<p>The
study involved over 180,000 women over 50 years of age across 10
studies. The sample size is huge and this analysis is the first to
assess the breast cancer risk impact over sustained weight loss. The
study did examine weight three times across 10 years period viz. at
the time of enrollment, post five years and again four years
thereafter. 
</p>



<p>The
results showed that women who were able to reduce more weight in
later adulthood and sustained it were able to lower the risk of
breast cancer. The women who were able to shed around 9 kg’s of
weight and then game some of it but not all did show a significant
reduction in breast cancer risk. 
</p>



<p> The lead author of the study Lauren Teras, PhD says ‘These findings may be a strong motivator for the two thirds of American women who are overweight to lose some of that weight. Even if you gain weight after age 50, it is not too late to lower your risk of breast cancer”.</p>

<p>One
of the common cancers across the world, Hodgkin Lymphoma affects the
lymphatic system of the body. The cancer causes the cells in the
lymphatic systems grow uncontrollably and spread across the body.
There are mainly two types of lymphoma cancers, Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)
and the other Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). The latter is much more
common as compared to the first one. The treatment is different for
both and hence it’s vital to know what kind of lymphoma you suffer
from.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hodgkin-Lymphoma-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-id="1159" data-link="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/?attachment_id=1159" class="wp-image-1159" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hodgkin-Lymphoma-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hodgkin-Lymphoma-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hodgkin-Lymphoma-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hodgkin-Lymphoma.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></figure></li></ul>



<p>Hodgkin’s
Lymphoma usually occurs around 20 to 40 years of age of after 55. 
The risk factors for this condition include a family history with the
condition and a history of Epstein Barr infection. The condition is
most common in between 15 and 30 year olds and particularly males. 
</p>



<p>The
diagnosis requires a physical examination and blood tests, imaging
tests or biopsy if lymph node as well as bone marrow if needed.  The
treatment is based on the diagnosis and the stage of cancer. The
Hodgkin’s lymphoma has four stages of cancers. 
</p>



<p><strong>Cancer
Stages</strong></p>



<p><strong>Stage
1</strong> – It’s the preliminary stage of cancer when it is limited
to the single organ or lymph node only.</p>



<p><strong>Stage
2</strong> – If the cancer has spread through other lymph nodes and
another nearby organ as well, it is stage 2.</p>



<p><strong>Stage
3</strong> – Stage 3 cancer is when the cancer spreads to lymph nodes
both above and below the diaphragm.  
</p>



<p><strong>Stage
4</strong> – Known to be the most advanced stage of Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, Stage IV is when the cancer is spread through lymph nodes
as well as other parts of the body like lungs, bones and liver. 
</p>



<p>If
diagnosed at an early stage the cancer can be cured to a great extent
and even the life expectancy levels increase. Though, accurate
diagnosis is the key and it requires an expert pathologist to do so
because there have been a lot of cases of misdiagnosis based on
biopsy tests due to lack of experience. So, a good idea is to take
second opinion even if it is diagnosed.</p>



<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>



<p> Based on the diagnosis, the treatment involves chemotherapy sessions that uses chemicals to treat the affected cells. Post the chemotherapy, radiation therapy is carried out. At times they are done in combination. While chemotherapy can be done using pill or even through veins, radiation therapy involves usage of high energy rays like protons and X-rays to kill the cancer causing cells. The therapy is spread over several weeks and is carried out daily for half an hour period. Another option that could work is bone marrow transplant but there is a possibility of underlying infection risk.  Targeted therapy is another kind of treatment that focuses on targeting specific cells and immunotherapy works in activating your immune system to fight these cancer cells. If these treatment are of no use then genetic mutations is another way that involves using drugs that target specific mutations of the lymphoma cells. Targeted therapy is the latest in cancer treatment options and is under research.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Many women aren’t aware that <strong>ovarian cancer</strong> is also known as the Silent Killer because generally no visible symptoms indicate the presence of this cancer and the symptoms surface only during the final stages. This cancer has known to affect as many as over 20K women across the world every year and due to the lack of visible symptoms indicating the cancer, it makes this cancer even scarier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CAUSES AND RISKS</strong><br />
The causes of this cancer are not clear as yet but family history is one of the risk factors and the women having a family member or relative with ovarian cancer or breast cancer are definitely at a higher risk of the same. Age can also be termed as one of the risk factors because most women get it after 60 -63 years. Also, the women who have had one or more pregnancies before the age of 26 are at a lower risk. The risk is lower if the number of pregnancies is higher. Even using contraceptives frequently tends to lower the risk of ovarian cancer. As per doctors there is this contraceptive hormone called DMPA or Depo pro-vera CI that if injected of more than 3 years, reduces the risk of ovarian cancer even further. Women who make use of infertility treatment drugs over a period of one year are also known to have a high risk of getting ovarian cancer. Other risk factors include obesity, hormone therapy and gynecologic surgery as in surgery of reproductive organs and getting endometriosis at the age of 30 years.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1010 size-medium alignleft" src="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ovarian-cancer-300x300.jpg" alt="Ovarian Cancer" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ovarian-cancer-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ovarian-cancer-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ovarian-cancer-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ovarian-cancer-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ovarian-cancer-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DIAGNOSIS AND STAGES</strong><br />
The doctor on examination will ask for some tests that include blood test, a CT scan or MRI as well as Laparoscopy, biopsy, abdominal fluid aspiration test or colonoscopy for that matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stages</strong><br />
As per the American Cancer society ovarian cancer has four stages<br />
<strong>Stage 1</strong> – This is the preliminary stage of ovarian cancer where only the ovary or the ovaries are affected.<br />
<strong>Stage 2</strong> – This is the secondary stage where the cancer is out of the ovaries and spread around the areas like fallopian tubes, uterus, rectum or the bladder.<br />
<strong>Stage 3</strong> – This is a later stage of cancer where the cancer affects the lymph nodes, abdominal lining or even the back of the abdomen.<br />
<strong>Stage 4</strong> – The last stage of cancer where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body outside the peritoneal cavity viz. abdomen or pelvis upto the liver, fluid around the lungs or the spleen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>SYMPTOMS</b><br />
The initial symptoms of<em> ovarian cancer</em> are easy to miss because they are very much similar to premenstrual syndrome. So, you have to be alert and if you find any of the below mentioned symptoms that persist for a long time then good idea is to go for checkup.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Recurring Abdominal Pain</strong><br />
If you have been experiencing stomach ache for a long time even if you don’t have your monthly cycles then its time you get it tested.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Appetite loss and Nausea</strong><br />
When ovarian cancer starts spreading around, it affects the bowel system and causes nausea. If you feel you have been experiencing and loss in your appetite or feeling full sooner than ever, check it out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bloating and Constipation</strong><br />
When a tumor is growing inside you even when you do not eat much you feel fuller and bloated. It can also affect your bowel movement leading to regular constipation issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Irregular monthly cycles</strong><br />
A tumor in the ovary will cause your monthly period to become irregular or sorts. So, if you haven’t been experiencing any irregularity in your monthly periods earlier but only lately for a while, good idea to meet up with your doctor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Frequent urination</strong><br />
If you have been making frequent trips to the bathroom for peeing then this could be the sign. Do not ignore and visit your doctor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TREATMENT</strong><br />
The treatment is based on the diagnosis of the stage of the cancer and includes procedures like surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy as well as hormonal therapy. One or more treatments in combination are usually used depending upon the stage of the cancer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Surgery types</strong><br />
The extent of surgery is also based on the stage and includes removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus as well the affected surrounding tissues. Then there is de-bulking surgery and lymph node dissections also which is done to reduce the cancerous tissues if the cancer is spread beyond the pelvic region and removal of lymph nodes near the aorta respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Therapy types</strong><br />
Chemotherapy is generally done post-surgery to kill the remaining cancer cells. A medication known as cytotoxic medication poisonous drugs to the cells in-order to prevent growth and division. This is a recurring process based on the cancer growth. Targeted Chemotherapy is another treatment that involves target specific function or pathways of cancer cells. Another therapy that is used as a part to treatment is <strong>Hormone therapy</strong>. It is done to cut the supply of estrogen from the cancer cells in order to slow their growth. Radiation therapy is also used for treatment of cancer and is generally used in advanced form of cancer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Survival</strong><br />
As the stage increases the survival rate decreases. While for Stage I there is a 90% chance of survival, for stage IV, the chance is 17%.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently Bollywood celebrity Irfan Khan is known to be diagnosed by Neuroendocrine Tumor. In order to restrain his fans and people in general from any kind of speculation he even went on to clarify that neuro does not always mean about the brain. He had to do that post rumors of he suffering from brain tumor surfaced across the social media. Well, as he is out of the country right now and is getting treated, best wishes of all the country are with him. Well, for those who are unaware about neuroendocrine tumor here’s a rundown this condition.</p>
<p>Neuroendocrine tumor or NET is a tumor which does not generally show any major symptoms as it grows slowly. Once the tumor grows or if it releases hormones while it is functional is when symptoms surface.<br />
Types of Endocrine tumors include pancreatic endocrine tumor, gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors and lung neuroendocrine tumors.</p>
<p>Pancreatic Neuro Endocrine Tumors – This is a rare kind of tumor. The symptoms of this cancer are subject to the hormones released by it. The symptoms generally include the following</p>
<ol>
<li>Stomach Ulcers</li>
<li>Heart burn</li>
<li>Jaundice</li>
<li>Low or high blood Sugar levels</li>
<li>Blood clots</li>
<li>Patches of red itchy and painful skin</li>
<li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
</ol>
<p>When the gastrin in body increases excessively it causes Zollinger Ellison syndrome further increasing the quantity of stomach acid ultimately causing small intestine or stomach ulcers. The symptoms include</p>
<ol>
<li>Severe Diarrhea</li>
<li>Heartburn</li>
<li>Abdominal Pain</li>
<li>Pain in abdomen</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>Blood vomits</li>
<li>Weight loss</li>
</ol>
<p>When the level of cortisol increases highly inside the body it causes cushing syndrome. When too much Adrenocorticotrpic hormone is released it leads to lung NETs which leads to adrenal glands making too much cortisol. The symptoms are as follows –</p>
<ol>
<li>Muscle weakness</li>
<li>Increase in hair growth on body and face</li>
<li>High blood sugar</li>
<li>Weight gain</li>
<li>Fat build up above the collar bone below the shoulders</li>
<li>Mood swing and behavioral changes</li>
<li>Purple lines on skin</li>
</ol>
<p>Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors – This tumor develops in any part of the gastrointestinal tract besides large and small intestine. The symptoms are as follows –</p>
<ol>
<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Anemia with fatigue</li>
<li>Weight loss</li>
<li>Constipation or intestine blockage</li>
<li>Blood in stool or rectal bleeding</li>
<li>Heartburn or indigestion</li>
<li>Abdominal/ rectal pain or discomfort</li>
</ol>
<p>Lung Neuroendocrine tumors &#8211; This tumor develops in the bronchi. Symptoms include</p>
<ol>
<li>Never ceasing cough</li>
<li>Blood in cough</li>
<li>Difficulty Breathing</li>
<li>Pneumonia</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Skin flushing, wheezing and diarrhea (Carcinoid Syndrome)</li>
</ol>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">Yes, you read that right. Though it does not hold true for all, it does hold true for men who drink tea while they are also regular consumers of alcohol and smoke tobacco. Particularly in under developed regions of countries like China <strong>esophageal cancer</strong> is quite common. Chinese men drink tea besides smoking and being alcoholic. Esophageal cancer has very low survival rates and the rate at which it is spreading its wings in these countries is worrisome.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Drinking-Hot-Tea-Increases-The-Chances-Of-Cancer-By-5-Times-1-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-790 size-medium" src="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Drinking-Hot-Tea-Increases-The-Chances-Of-Cancer-By-5-Times-1-300x168.jpg" alt="Drinking Hot Tea Increases The Chances Of Cancer By 5 Times" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Researchers of the National Natural science foundation of china as well as national key research and development program went on to undertake a survey in China to test if consuming hot tea is associated with esophageal cancer risk. The study was done on 456155 participants between the age-group of 30 and 79 for around 9.2 years of median followup. The researchers found out that drinking hot tea while being an alcoholic and smoker did increase the risk of esophageal cancer. The participants who smoked, consumed alcohol and hot tea did tend to risk esophageal cancer risk by 5 times as compared to participants with none of the three habits. Though, the participants who did not consume alcohol or smoke were not subject to the risk of esophageal cancer.</p>
<p>The study is based on observations and hence its you cannot determine the cause and effect link, but the researchers do speculate that hot tea does damage the lining of the tissue inside the esophagus, thus increasing the chances of injury due to smoking and drinking as well. It can possibly form inflammatory compounds post repeated irritation to the esophagus, thereby increasing the risk of cancer as well.</p>
<p>Having said that, we have also come across contradictory statements with regards to cancer and tea. In the recent past WHO did conclude that beverages with temperatures above 149 degrees F including did increase the risk of esophageal cancer, however tea has been excluded most of the times in the past from the cancer causing beverages. Furthermore green tea is known to be lowering cancer risk as well.</p>
<p>So a better idea is to consume tea at less higher temperatures that do not risk the chance of causing esophageal <a title="Cancer Hospitals in Bangalore" href="http://hospital.rrmch.org/department/surgical-oncology/" target="_blank">cancer</a>. Obviously, it goes without saying that you need to stay away from addictions like smoking or alcohol as well.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">Cancer is killing people across the world and there is a significant rise in the number of deaths that are caused by cancer. We are all aware that the cancer detection and treatment as well as life expectancy has lot of do with the stage of detection. The earlier you detect it the more the life expectancy and possibility of eliminating it completely. Here is some good news in the regard. Researchers at MIT have recently found a way to detect cancer at an early stage which always has been a challenge as the particular proteins that cancer cells secrete are not easy to detect, thus aiding cancer growth prior discovery.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Early-Cancer-Detection-To-Be-Easier-In-The-Coming-Times-1-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-785 size-medium" src="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Early-Cancer-Detection-To-Be-Easier-In-The-Coming-Times-1-300x168.jpg" alt="Early Cancer Detection To Be Easier In The Coming Times" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p align="justify">Now there is a breakthrough in cancer research at MIT wherein, using nanotechnology, researchers can make tests to detect potential life threatening conditions like Alzheimer’s, cancer and more in the early stage. They used the nano-technology in the blood scanner. It is especially useful in detection on cancers within the body like ovarian, pancreatic and lung cancer including 100 types.</p>
<p align="justify">Presently, the most popular method of detecting cancer is MRI scan, CT scan or a biopsy. But, the fact still remains that even these technologies aren’t able to detect micro-metasteses or micro tumors due to the minute size of them. Using Nanotechnology though, practitioners can effectively detect them and find out where the cancer is growing and spreading. These light emitting nano particles allow tracking of cancer in real time. The results are based on the research that was carried out by a team on a mouse model with human breast cancer. They injected the nano-probes, tiny X-ray using optical devices for detecting micro-tumors. These probes move around or commute through the blood stream and locate the cancer cells where-ever there are. These work quite faster than MRI and have the ability to identify micro-tumors in suprarenal, adrenal, bones and other animal glands.</p>
<p align="justify">In a nutshell, the researchers believe that they have been able to find the address of cancer now, as it can detect withing the first five years itself, if used. If this projection works in humans well then it will help save many lives.</p>
