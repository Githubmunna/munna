<p><strong>Breast cancer</strong> is one of the most common cancers amongst women in India and worldwide. A recent study about women who lost weight at 50 and maintained a healthy weight thereon showed a decreased risk of breast cancer as compared to women with more weight.  This study is therefore a way to help women work around prevention of cancer.  </p>

<p>The
study is published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
In USA over two third of the adult women are overweight or obese. The
study was carried out by the researchers at the American Cancer
Society, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health using the Pooling
Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer (DCPP) in order to
determine the connection between sustained loss of weight after
menopause or later adulthood and the risk of breast cancer.</p>



<p>The
study involved over 180,000 women over 50 years of age across 10
studies. The sample size is huge and this analysis is the first to
assess the breast cancer risk impact over sustained weight loss. The
study did examine weight three times across 10 years period viz. at
the time of enrollment, post five years and again four years
thereafter. 
</p>



<p>The
results showed that women who were able to reduce more weight in
later adulthood and sustained it were able to lower the risk of
breast cancer. The women who were able to shed around 9 kg’s of
weight and then game some of it but not all did show a significant
reduction in breast cancer risk. 
</p>



<p> The lead author of the study Lauren Teras, PhD says ‘These findings may be a strong motivator for the two thirds of American women who are overweight to lose some of that weight. Even if you gain weight after age 50, it is not too late to lower your risk of breast cancer”.</p>

<p>One
of the common cancers across the world, Hodgkin Lymphoma affects the
lymphatic system of the body. The cancer causes the cells in the
lymphatic systems grow uncontrollably and spread across the body.
There are mainly two types of lymphoma cancers, Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)
and the other Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). The latter is much more
common as compared to the first one. The treatment is different for
both and hence it’s vital to know what kind of lymphoma you suffer
from.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hodgkin-Lymphoma-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-id="1159" data-link="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/?attachment_id=1159" class="wp-image-1159" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hodgkin-Lymphoma-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hodgkin-Lymphoma-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hodgkin-Lymphoma-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hodgkin-Lymphoma.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></figure></li></ul>



<p>Hodgkin’s
Lymphoma usually occurs around 20 to 40 years of age of after 55. 
The risk factors for this condition include a family history with the
condition and a history of Epstein Barr infection. The condition is
most common in between 15 and 30 year olds and particularly males. 
</p>



<p>The
diagnosis requires a physical examination and blood tests, imaging
tests or biopsy if lymph node as well as bone marrow if needed.  The
treatment is based on the diagnosis and the stage of cancer. The
Hodgkin’s lymphoma has four stages of cancers. 
</p>



<p><strong>Cancer
Stages</strong></p>



<p><strong>Stage
1</strong> – It’s the preliminary stage of cancer when it is limited
to the single organ or lymph node only.</p>



<p><strong>Stage
2</strong> – If the cancer has spread through other lymph nodes and
another nearby organ as well, it is stage 2.</p>



<p><strong>Stage
3</strong> – Stage 3 cancer is when the cancer spreads to lymph nodes
both above and below the diaphragm.  
</p>



<p><strong>Stage
4</strong> – Known to be the most advanced stage of Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, Stage IV is when the cancer is spread through lymph nodes
as well as other parts of the body like lungs, bones and liver. 
</p>



<p>If
diagnosed at an early stage the cancer can be cured to a great extent
and even the life expectancy levels increase. Though, accurate
diagnosis is the key and it requires an expert pathologist to do so
because there have been a lot of cases of misdiagnosis based on
biopsy tests due to lack of experience. So, a good idea is to take
second opinion even if it is diagnosed.</p>



<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>



<p> Based on the diagnosis, the treatment involves chemotherapy sessions that uses chemicals to treat the affected cells. Post the chemotherapy, radiation therapy is carried out. At times they are done in combination. While chemotherapy can be done using pill or even through veins, radiation therapy involves usage of high energy rays like protons and X-rays to kill the cancer causing cells. The therapy is spread over several weeks and is carried out daily for half an hour period. Another option that could work is bone marrow transplant but there is a possibility of underlying infection risk.  Targeted therapy is another kind of treatment that focuses on targeting specific cells and immunotherapy works in activating your immune system to fight these cancer cells. If these treatment are of no use then genetic mutations is another way that involves using drugs that target specific mutations of the lymphoma cells. Targeted therapy is the latest in cancer treatment options and is under research.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In<em> India Breast Cancer</em> is the top occurring cancer amongst females with a mortality rate of 12.7 per 1,00,000. A non-invasive form of breast cancer, <em><strong>Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)</strong></em> is a common form of cancer in India. Ductal means ducts as its starts in the milk ducts and carcinoma means cancer that starts in the skin or any other tissues covering the internal organs and in situ means in its original place. The reason this cancer is known as non- invasive cancer is that is has not spread beyond the milk duct to the neighboring tissues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">DCIS is a grade 0 cancer and is not a life threatening cancer but having it in first place does increase the risk of developing an invasive breast cancer later on compared to people who haven’t had it before. The possibility of recurrence is usually 5 or 10 years post the first appearance with a 30% likelihood.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1017" src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-DCIS.jpg" alt="Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)" width="500" height="287" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-DCIS.jpg 500w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-DCIS-300x172.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The possibility of recurrence in women undergoing the breast conserving surgery is around 25% to 30% . To lower the risk of recurrence by 15% you need to include radiation therapy in the treatment plan. Also, if DCIS comes back after treatment it could either be non-invasive or invasive too, chances are 50% for each.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Here’s a look through the symptoms, causes, diagnosis and treatment of the condition.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DICS &#8211; Symptoms</strong><br />
Generally there are no visible symptoms of DCIS. Only a few people might have a lump in the breast or some nipple discharge. Diagnosis is only possible for most of the cases through mammography.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DICS – Diagnosis</strong><br />
<strong>Breast Examination</strong> – A physical examination of breasts is carried out if a lump is present though such lump is rarely noticeable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mammography</strong> – A mammography can easily detect DCIS. Even when a physical examination fails, mammography can be used to detect DCIS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Biopsy</strong> – Biopsy is only carried out when a mammogram does not give a clear result. There are two kinds of non-invasive biopsies which involve a bit of surgery.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Core needle biopsy</strong> – A large needle is inserted for a big sample of tissue from the suspicious area.</li>
<li><strong> Fine needle biopsy</strong> &#8211; A sample of cells are obtained by inserting a small hollow needle in the breast and then examining it under the microscope.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though more invasive biopsies are rarely need for DCIS, if the above are not able to give conclusive results then biopsies like incisional and excisional biopsy’s are to be done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Treatment</strong> – Once the diagnosis confirms DCIS, surgery is done to remove the <a href="http://hospital.rrmch.org/department/surgical-oncology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancer</a> as well as the border of the healthy tissues surrounding the cancer, known as the clear margins. This means doing the procedure of lumpectomy or sometimes mastectomy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">Ramadevi Nimmanapalli, a cancer researcher by profession had been in the US till 2015. She returned to India leaving behind this career in order to take up another challenging opportunity of setting up a faculty of Veterinary and Animal Sciences at the Benaras Hindu University in Varanasi. She herself had done her Science Graduation from Sri Venkateswara Veterinary University in Hyderabad after which she did her Masters in Sciences, topping the University. She further went to Oxford to pursue PhD there.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cancer-to-Curd-1-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-822" src="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cancer-to-Curd-1-1.jpg" alt="Cancer to Curd" width="600" height="381" /></a></p>
<p align="justify">Describing her experience in Oxford England as a rather challenging one even though she was a topper, she mentioned that the education system in India and England was different. Catching up was quite a task because Indian education courses do not offer in-depth study as compared to Oxford. So, she had to work really hard with her research in microbiology in bluetongue virus that affects deers and cattle as well. After completing her Phd. She shifted to USA where she researched in areas of human cancer and chemical pathways for drug Gleevac. Before returning to India she was teaching at the Philadelphia college of Osteopathic Medicine and MD Anderson Cancer centre, Tuskagee University.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="justify"><a title="Best Cancer Hospitals in Bangalore" href="https://hospital.rrmch.org/department/surgical-oncology/" target="_blank"><strong>BEST CANCER HOSPITAL IN BANGALORE</strong></a></p>
<p align="justify">Though shifting to India was also not an easy decision for her as she was already married and living there with her husband, it’s when her husband supported the decision to take the decision to go to Indi without him joining her right away, after she moved here.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, in India, as the Dean at the Benaras University, she is all set to revive the faculty which already has a dairy farm on its main campus besides a research ready campus that is being setup in Mirzapur for MSc and Doctoral students, which is nearby. She is working hard to set up this new faculty and her straight forward attitude which she brought along as a learning from her USA lifestyle has been of a great aid. She has already published around 40 research papers but the one that stands out is about dealing and characterization of curd or dahi. Though the founding dean of the faculty has not had any admissions, later this year, the faculty is going to welcome its first batch of undergraduate students. The team is ready, the labs are set and the preparations are on to take the plunge. Though a lot of preparations are underway as well, as per the Dean, it’s a long way to go.</p>
