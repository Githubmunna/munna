As the corona virus or Wuhan
virus scare is catching like wild fire and as the number of infected
people across the world. The cases in china are about to reach 15000
and over 300 people are  said to be already affected. The virus is on
the spread across the world as it is highly contagious and the UN has
already declared it as a medical emergency.  While the world is on
high alert and is also flown out their nationals from the country,
the clouds of this virus causing a havoc are already mounting. Here
are a few tips to keep the corona virus infection at bay.

	water on regular basis or with alcohol based disinfectant
	</li><li>

	</li><li>

	Avoid close contact with
	people suffering from cold or flu like symptoms 
	
	</li><li>

	Do not eat under cooked meat
	or eggs

	animals or the wild
	</li><li>

	surfaces that are dirty or touched
	</li><li>

	Avoid touching your mouth,
	eyes or hands with dirty hands
	</li><li>

	</li><li>

	Always carry a disinfectant

<p>
There’s also a debate around
the transfer of the virus without showing symptoms. While the Germans
are firm that asymptomatic transmission is possible, nothing is yet
officially conveyed.</p>



<p> Well, as the cases in China keep exploding as the days pass by, the risk of it spreading across continents is always there. As of now the process of developing a vaccine for controlling the virus is on but it might take almost a year before it comes to the pharmacy. Until then, prevention is the only way out. So, stay safe and clean to keep the condition out of harm’s way.  </p>
