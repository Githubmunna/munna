The ruler of Ajman, <strong> H. H. Sheikh Humaid Bin Rashid Al Nuaimi </strong> conferred this honor on Sri. A. C. Shanmugam, the Chairman. The honor was conferred in recognition of his excellent service to the Medical, Dental and allied Sciences which he did by establishing Institutions of Excellence in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.  Another exemplary contribution of Sri. A. C. Shanmugam in the field of Medical Science is the introduction of “<strong>Free Medical and Dental treatments</strong>” for poor patients at these Institutions.  His act of philanthropy in establishing and running various homes for Orphans, Destitute and Senior citizens has been well appreciated and has been taken into account for considering him for the honor.   Sri. A. C. Shanmugam has 26 institutions in which several million rupees are awarded as scholarship to deserving students. <br />
It is a unique honor to be conferred on a person from Non Medical fraternity.</p>
