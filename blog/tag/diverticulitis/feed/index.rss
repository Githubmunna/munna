<p>A
common condition of stomach that, many people are unaware of
diverticulitis. It affects the large intestine or colon and occurs
when the mucosa or muscous membrane forms small pouches bulging
inside the gastrointestinal tract pushes out via a weak muscle area
in the larger intestine.  Though over 80% of the people suffering
from divurticulitis do not show any symptoms of it, some of them do
feel severe pain and need surgery.

experience symptoms like fever, bloating, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, constipation, Vitamin D deficiency and genetics to name a few.

urine and stool test, colonoscopy, MRI, CT scan or X ray of the GI
tract, to name a few. 
</p>

complications.  The complications of divertulitis include – 
</p>



<p><strong>Abscess
</strong>– It is the formation of pus inside the diverticula 
</p>



<p><strong>Scarring

severe condition that leads to leakage into the abdominal cavity</p>



<p><strong>Fistula</strong>
– In this condition, the infection spreads through other organs 
</p>



<p><strong>Phlegmon</strong>
– It’s the inflammation of the soft tissues under the skin</p>



<p><strong>Prevention</strong>– Eating foods that are rich in fibre are advisable in order to prevent the condition. These include Vegetables like Spinach, Peas, high-fibre fruits, ground Psyllium Seed, low fibre animal protiens like eggs and fish etc. Avoid foods like popcorn, fried foods, saturated fats, popcorn and refined grains.  </p>
