<p>Addiction
to alcohol ain’t good for your health, is what we are all aware
off.  The consequences of the same include cancers of certain type,
liver damage, and heart as well as brain disease too.  Having said
that there are studies about health benefits of drinking in limit as
well. One such recent study has found that alcohol intake in
moderation does protect against mortality due to cardiovascular
diseases.

<p>The
study published in Journal of Alcohol and Drugs and lead by a team of
Boston medical center in Massachusetts presents a fresh approach
towards the long going debate on whether moderate drinking is good
for health. 
</p>



<p>As
per the researchers, the studies carried out earlier were not
accurate enough. The reason was that the study included participants
of age above 50. The researchers argue that people who have passed
away before 50 due to alcohol consumption are not included in the
study. Hence, people who aren’t alive cannot participate in a
cohort study. 
</p>



<p>As
per Dr. Timothy Naimi, alcohol addicts who are alive at 50 could have
been healthy before and also could have been drinking within limits
also. The authors were of the opinion that around 40 percent of the
deaths due to alcohol intake were before the age of 50 years, meaning
the deaths due to alcohol intake are not taken into consideration at
all leading to ignoring the dangers of it. 
</p>



<p>The
analysis showed that age played a major role in the risk levels
associated with alcohol.  The rate of alcohol related deaths in
people between the age group of 20 – 49 was 35.8 percent.  They
also studied individual of age above 65 years.  The study did show
that over 35 percent of the deaths occurred due to alcohol intake but
they also found that around 80 percent of the deaths in this age
group. 
</p>



<p>They also found a vast difference when they took into consideration the age group of 20-49 years and the lost number of years. The number of years saved by drinking were around 14.5 percent only.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Allergies are very common amongst us. Either we know we are allergic to stuff based on our experience post consumption of these foods or we aren’t. Many people have hiccups on eating spicy stuff like a chilly, while many get a runny nose. There are people who suffer from lactose intolerance and suffer from diarrhea after consuming foods like milk or cheese. But, if you think all these are allergies, then you aren’t completely right. These can be categorized under food intolerance or insensitivity. A food allergy is not the same. It occurs when your body considers harmless food to apparently harm the body. Food allergies could range from creating simple reactions like rashes on skin, or irritation to eyes or breathing problems to turn out to be life threatening if immediate steps are not taken. The best way to keep yourself safe is to be aware of such triggers and avoid them.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s look through 10 different food allergens and their side effects or reactions they cause. The most common allergens are as follows &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Eggs</strong> &#8211; The trigger that causes food allergies in eggs is egg protein like conalbumin, ovumucoid and ovalbumin. This allergy is found mostly in children than in adults. Some of the allergens are destroyed when the eggs are cooked but not all. This allergy can also cause anaphylaxis. The allergy can vary from person to person. While some might be allergic to yoke, some to egg white and some to all.</p>
<p><a href="http://hospital.rrmch.org/department/cardiology/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-995 size-full" src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/best-hospitals-in-bangalore.jpg" alt="" width="397" height="41" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/best-hospitals-in-bangalore.jpg 397w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/best-hospitals-in-bangalore-300x31.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fish</strong> &#8211; Fish allergy could be really harmful. It can be life threatening and lead to anaphylaxis. The allergy can show reactions like throat swelling, diarrhea and puking, skin irritations, blood pressure drop and anaphylaxis as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Milk</strong> – Many children may be allergic to cow’s milk. It can also be passed to the child indirectly through breast feeding. Many children out-grow of the allergy once adults but one fifth of them are said to have it in their adulthood too. The presence of the milk antibodies can be determined with the help of the blood test.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Soyabean</strong> &#8211; Soy bean is also one of the common allergy to have. The reactions of soya bean allergy includes vomiting, diarrhea, ashes as well as stomach cramps. Sometimes it could also cause swelling of the tongue, lips as well as hand, feet and puffed eyes too. Other reactions include bloating, flatulence. Though, it rarely gets life threatening and cause anaphylaxis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Shellfish</strong> – Shell fish includes aquatic life like shrimp, oyster, crabs, mussels, clams, scallops, to name a few. This allergy can get serious and even vapor of the cooking shell fish can be allergic. The reaction are very much similar to other allergic reactions</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as allergens go, prevention is always the best idea. So be aware of allergies if you have any and avoid food that can cause allergies primarily. Also, in case you get one for the first time, take immediate action and consult a doctor without wasting much of a time.</p>
