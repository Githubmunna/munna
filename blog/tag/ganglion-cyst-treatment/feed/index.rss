								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Many of you might not have heard about this condition but it does exist and is a common condition for the age group of 20 to 40 years. A ganglion cyst is a tumor or swelling caused either on the tendon viz. the tissue that connects muscle to the bone or the top of a joint. The cyst is sticky and colourless and looks like a sac of liquid. The size of the cyst may vary and it could feel spongy as well. There could either be on single cyst or one large one and multiple number of smaller ones around it connected by a common stalk within the deeper tissue. Also known as Bible cyst, is not harmful and around 70% people experience it in their lifetime. Ganglion cysts are very rare in age-groups less than 10 years. Ganglion cysts usually develop on the back of the hand. They are found at the joint of the wrist but can also be seen on the side of the palm. The other rare but possible sites of cyst include mucous cysts occurring right below the cuticle on the fingertip, the foot top, as pea sized bumps on the palm finger base, as well as the outer part of the ankle as well as the knee.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Causes</strong><br />
As on day the causes of the cyst are not known. As per doctors it could be due to breakdown of the tissue joint as a result of some trauma. Another theory mentions joint capsule fault or in that of the tendon sheath leading to joint tissue bulge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If you have a bulge or bump of changing mass.</li>
<li>If the diameter is 1-3 cm and it does not move</li>
<li>There is a sudden swelling or a gradual one</li>
<li>If it is recurring after a certain period of time</li>
<li>Ganglion cysts do cause pain followed by acute trauma even if they donâ€™t appear.</li>
<li>If it pains it could get worse due to joint motion</li>
<li>In cysts that are connected to the tendon, you feel weakness in the finger</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Medical Advice</strong><br />
Medical evaluation of the cyst is important whether or not you have all the symptoms. This will help the doctor in making it sure and offering a suitable line of treatment. The doctor could advise on an ultrasound or test using the cyst fluid. At times even a MRI could be advised by the doctor though it is an expensive procedure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Treatment</strong><br />
Ganglion Cysts can be treated with hot bags at home. Sometimes if there is pain, doctor may prescribe a pain killer as well. Surgical or cosmetic removal of cysts of bigger size can be done but they could reoccur as well.</p>
