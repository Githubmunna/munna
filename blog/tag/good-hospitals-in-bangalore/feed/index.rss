As the corona virus or Wuhan
virus scare is catching like wild fire and as the number of infected
people across the world. The cases in china are about to reach 15000
and over 300 people are  said to be already affected. The virus is on
the spread across the world as it is highly contagious and the UN has
already declared it as a medical emergency.  While the world is on
high alert and is also flown out their nationals from the country,
the clouds of this virus causing a havoc are already mounting. Here
are a few tips to keep the corona virus infection at bay. 
</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Corona-Virus.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1261" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Corona-Virus.jpg 800w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Corona-Virus-300x167.jpg 300w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Corona-Virus-768x427.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></figure>



<ol><li>

	Wash your hands with soap and
	water on regular basis or with alcohol based disinfectant
	</li><li>

	While sneezing or coughing
	cover your mouth with a tissue or hand
	</li><li>

	Avoid close contact with
	people suffering from cold or flu like symptoms 
	
	</li><li>

	Do not eat under cooked meat
	or eggs
	</li><li>

	Avoid contact with farm
	animals or the wild
	</li><li>

	Stay indoors at home when
	sick
	</li><li>

	Clean all objects and
	surfaces that are dirty or touched
	</li><li>

	Avoid touching your mouth,
	eyes or hands with dirty hands
	</li><li>

	Use a mask whenever outdoor 
	
	</li><li>

	Always carry a disinfectant
	along when outdoor
</li></ol>



<p>
There’s also a debate around
the transfer of the virus without showing symptoms. While the Germans
are firm that asymptomatic transmission is possible, nothing is yet
officially conveyed.</p>



<p> Well, as the cases in China keep exploding as the days pass by, the risk of it spreading across continents is always there. As of now the process of developing a vaccine for controlling the virus is on but it might take almost a year before it comes to the pharmacy. Until then, prevention is the only way out. So, stay safe and clean to keep the condition out of harm’s way.  </p>

<p>
If You are suffering from
stomach related issues then, one of the most recommended diets is the
BRAT diet. For the uninitiated, BRAT is an acronym standing for
Banana, rice, Applesauce and toast. The reason behind recommending
these foods when having stomach problems is that they are light on
the stomach and bland as well. Stomach problems can lead to nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea and fatigue and the BRAT diet definitely plays a
role in keeping you energized without side effects. 
</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/BRAT-Diet.jpg" alt="Brat Diet For Stomach Health" class="wp-image-1258" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/BRAT-Diet.jpg 770w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/BRAT-Diet-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/BRAT-Diet-768x499.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></figure>



<p>
The BRAT diet is about eating
bananas, applesauce, rice and toast in abundance as these foods are
bland I taste and easy on your digestive systems. Well, if you cannot
eat the same food over and over until you get well, you may choose
from other bland foods like weak tea, apple juice or soda, broth,
boiled potatoes as well as cooked cereals.</p>



<p>
Though you need to avoid dairy
products like milk and more as well as oily, fried and spicy food.
You also need to avoid raw or uncooked food as well as food that is
very hot or very cold. Stay away from alcohol as well as coffee or
other foods containing caffeine. 
</p>



<p>
Once 24 hours of illness have
passed you may consume clear liquids again, sipping on at an interval
of 10 minutes. Try drinking water, chicken broth, apple juice and
similar liquids. 
</p>



<p>
Although the BRAT diet is a
common recommendation by Doctors in USA, children and infants are
excluded form the recommendation. 
</p>



<p>
The reason being that these
food cannot fulfil the body requirements in terms of micro nutrients
and proteins. 
</p>



<p> But, if you are suffering from severe bout of diarrhea then you need to seek medical assistance immediately. Also in case of severe abdominal or rectal pain, black or bloody stools or a high fever or above 102 F.  </p>

<p><strong>Breast cancer</strong> is one of the most common cancers amongst women in India and worldwide. A recent study about women who lost weight at 50 and maintained a healthy weight thereon showed a decreased risk of breast cancer as compared to women with more weight.  This study is therefore a way to help women work around prevention of cancer.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Weightloss-After-50-Years-Of-Age-Reduces-Breast-Cancer-Risk-1024x683.jpg" alt="Breast Cancer Risk" class="wp-image-1252" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Weightloss-After-50-Years-Of-Age-Reduces-Breast-Cancer-Risk-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Weightloss-After-50-Years-Of-Age-Reduces-Breast-Cancer-Risk-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Weightloss-After-50-Years-Of-Age-Reduces-Breast-Cancer-Risk-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></figure>



<p>The
study is published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
In USA over two third of the adult women are overweight or obese. The
study was carried out by the researchers at the American Cancer
Society, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health using the Pooling
Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer (DCPP) in order to
determine the connection between sustained loss of weight after
menopause or later adulthood and the risk of breast cancer.</p>



<p>The
study involved over 180,000 women over 50 years of age across 10
studies. The sample size is huge and this analysis is the first to
assess the breast cancer risk impact over sustained weight loss. The
study did examine weight three times across 10 years period viz. at
the time of enrollment, post five years and again four years
thereafter. 
</p>



<p>The
results showed that women who were able to reduce more weight in
later adulthood and sustained it were able to lower the risk of
breast cancer. The women who were able to shed around 9 kg’s of
weight and then game some of it but not all did show a significant
reduction in breast cancer risk. 
</p>



<p> The lead author of the study Lauren Teras, PhD says ‘These findings may be a strong motivator for the two thirds of American women who are overweight to lose some of that weight. Even if you gain weight after age 50, it is not too late to lower your risk of breast cancer”.</p>

<p>We
all know that pregnancy can bring along a lot of side effects also
like fatigue, nausea, vomiting and more. But, one rare condition that
only a few or say 1 in 160 women get are pregnancy PUPPPs. Though, it
is known to be a common condition experienced by pregnant women, not
all are aware of it. Here’s and over view of Pruritic Urticarial
Papules or PUPPPS, also known as plaques or Pregnancy. 
</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Plaques-of-Pregnancy-or-Puppp.jpg" alt="Plaques of Pregnancy or Puppp" class="wp-image-1249" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Plaques-of-Pregnancy-or-Puppp.jpg 600w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Plaques-of-Pregnancy-or-Puppp-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Plaques-of-Pregnancy-or-Puppp-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Plaques-of-Pregnancy-or-Puppp-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>Though
as on day scientists and medical experts aren’t really sure of the
reason behind the surfacing of such itchy rashes in women during
pregnancy but believe that it could be due to excessive stretching of
skin in the months nearing to delivery. 
</p>



<p>Also,
there is no cure. The rashes tend to appear in the third semester and
disappear within 2 weeks post birthing. The rashes start mostly from
the stomach and spread across your thighs, legs, hands and neck area.
They look like red swollen patches and are extremely itchy. 
</p>



<p>Another
reason cited by experts around rash is the circulation of immune
fetal cells through the body. These cells spark an immune response
that in turn leads to the rash surfacing. The theory finds support in
the fact that the fetal cells do stay in the body for short time
after delivery. But, it’s not proved yet. 
</p>



<p>The
itching could get worse if you tend to scratch it. Better to avoid
scratching. In hotter regions the itching and pain is much worse and
proper care needs to be taken for relief. Here are a few tips around
relief from rashes 
</p>



<ol><li>

	Ice – Cool ice compresses
	can help relieve the itching. Wrap the ice compress in a cloth and
	apply few time during the day. 
	
	</li><li>

	Oatmeal – Oatmeal baths are
	known to be effective home remedy for may skin conditions including
	this one. 
	
	</li><li>

	Peppermint – Peppermint
	comes with menthol and it is known to have cooling effects. Use
	peppermint oil on the rashes or you might consume the prescribed
	quantity after consulting your doctor. 
	
	</li><li>

	Moisturiser –
	</li><li>

	Clove oil &#8211;  Clove oil is
	also known to have  cooling effects because it contains
	antimicrobials and antioxidants, phenol eugenol to be specific. 
	
</li></ol>



<p>
A study in 2017 revealed that
around 25 participants who applied petroleum jelly followed by clove
oil on rash prone areas show a reduction in symptoms compared to the
group that used on petroleum jelly.</p>



<p> Having said that, not every pregnant woman gets these itchy rashes but those who get could use the above tips for relief purpose because these rashes could get itchy to hell and frustrate you to the core. But, be calm, this will pass off and there is not known effects to the fetus due to their occurrence as yet.</p>

<p>We
all know that board games are a fun way to be engaged in play in
doors particularly for kids. But, here’s some news. A new study
carried out by the Researchers at Edinburgh university of United
Kingdom reveals that board games could actually help Older Adults
avert off their cognitive decline. The paper was authored by Drew
Altschul of School of philosophy, Pscychology and Language sciences
in association with Professor Deary, director of Edinburgh Lothian
Birth Cohorts and published in the Journals of Gerontology. 
</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Board-Games.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1243" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Board-Games.jpg 1000w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Board-Games-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Board-Games-768x598.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /><figcaption>FBHDTJ Still-life selection of board games (Monopoly, Chess, Cluedo, Scrabble) with playing cards and gambling chips</figcaption></figure>



<p>The
study was carried out on 1091 subjects born in the year 1936 for
assessment of their mental and cognitive capabilities.  The
researchers did the evaluation for cognitive functioning across ages
11, 70, 73, 79 with the help of 14 different standard cognitive
tests.</p>



<p>The
study included asking questions to participants in the age group of
70 and 76 about how many times across the week they indulged in board
games like bingo, chess, crosswords, cards, bingo and more .  The
researchers also took into account confounding factors like
education, early life cognitive function, activity levels, sex and
health issues to name a few, as a part of their analysis. 
</p>



<p>The
results unleashed that the people who were more into board games in
their later year’s post 70’s were better off maintaining their
cognitive functioning. Particularly those older adults who indulged
in analog games post 70’s showed relative less decline in cognitive
abilities across 11 and 70 years and also between the age of 70 and
79. 
</p>



<p>Altschul,
one of the study leads says “ these latest findings add to evidence
that being more engaged in activities during the life course might be
associated with better thinking skills in later life”. 
</p>



<p>While coauthor thinks that there is a possibility that there is an interpretation of results as push to start playing board games and avoid cognitive decline.  </p>

<p>No
a new idea really, as there have been studies earlier around
relationship study between mental health and climatic conditions.
But, as the climatic conditions seen to be changing drastically and
global warming issues and more are becoming the talk of the town,
even the psychological health issues are becoming the areas of focus.
</p>



<p>The
earlier studies primarily were carried out for a short period of time
and only have been able to identify  the links between mental health
as well as temperature but the research till date only involves short
time period and more focused on connection rather than causal
factors. Moreover, this findings have so far not yielded any
substantial conclusions. So, the researchers with this study are
hoping to get answers to their questions that are not answered as

<p>The
researchers for their study has gathered data from various sources
including Californian emergency departments,  collecting data and
analyzing information from the data of mental health diagnosis visits
during the period of 2005 – 2016. 
</p>



<p>They
even mined for data around suicides in America during 1960 – 2016
period.  These information was based on statuses that were
individually self-reported.  After drilling the climatic temperature
in US down, the researchers managed to develop ‘’fine spatial and
temporal scales”.</p>



<p>From
the study the researchers concluded that the mental health outcomes
decrease as the temperatures cool and the increase mental health
issues with rise in temperatures. Statistically speaking they found
that there was a rise in 0.48% rise in mental health visits with a
rise in average monthly temperature of 1<sup>0</sup> F and even a
rise in suicides by 0.35%</p>



<p>In
short, the rise and drop in temperatures has a significant impact of
the mental health because the authors of the study also showed
stability in the estimates even when accounted for socio economic
status and air conditioning adoption. 
</p>



<p>As for suicide rate, it rises only if there is a rise in temperature amid the growing season because growing season is all about crop yields. If the temperature rises, the crop yield reduces and leads to financial issues that in turn increase the risk of suicides.  </p>

<p>The winter has
almost arrived, and with it has arrived the season of Indian Jujube,
or as we call them locally BER.  Not many are aware that they are
also known as the Korean date or Chinese date or even Indian Date. 
</p>



<p>A bite sized fruit, it is relished by many but very few of us really know about its umpteen health benefits.   Here’s a run down some of them –</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eat-Indian-Jujube-In-Abundance-1024x678.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1229" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eat-Indian-Jujube-In-Abundance-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eat-Indian-Jujube-In-Abundance-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eat-Indian-Jujube-In-Abundance-768x509.jpg 768w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eat-Indian-Jujube-In-Abundance.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></figure>

	Jujube can give you 69 mg of Vitamin C. Hence, eating jujube could
	be a great way of getting vitamin C as our body is not capable of
	producing the same. 
	
</li></ol>



<ol><li>

<p>Though
fruits and veggies are known to be healthy options as far as food is
concerned there are conflicting views over dairy products and even
their consumption levels on a regular basis.  Milk and milk products
in plenty are a must for kids and adolescents as milk is a rich
source of calcium.  Though milk is good, it comes under saturated
fats and hence for people on a diet skimmed milk is a better option. 
</p>



<p> As per global standards the average consumption is around 2 to 2.5 servings a day for children.  Organizations like USDA and <strong>National Institute of Health (NIH)</strong> dairy is a vital source of magnesium, phosphorous, Protein and Vitamin D. A deficiency in calcium could raise the risk of osteoporosis as bones become weak and brittle.  </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Horns-Of-The-Dilemma-–-Dairy-Good-Or-Bad-For-Health.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1225" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Horns-Of-The-Dilemma-–-Dairy-Good-Or-Bad-For-Health.jpg 512w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Horns-Of-The-Dilemma-–-Dairy-Good-Or-Bad-For-Health-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure></div>



<p>Having
said that there are conflicting views around consumption of dairy
products.  As per a systematic review as well as meta-analysis says
that increase in dairy consumption increases the risk of
osteoporosis. But, not all studies are included in the said analysis.
 
</p>



<p>Another
long term study of Sweden that included 61000 women and 45000 men
revealed a potential link between high milk consumption as well as
high rate of bone fractures.  Though a Japanese study carried out
over 94,980 people revealed that a rise in consumption of milk did
lower the mortality risk. 
</p>



<p>Even the <strong>American heart Institution (AHA)</strong> has said that saturated fats could lead to increase in cholesterol as well as heart disease. Hence, some full fat dairy products do not come in the list of heart healthy diet recommendations. Furthermore, the national lung and blood institute has advised people to limit their dairy intake and use low fat dairy in their diet.  </p>



<p>There
is an article with umpteen analyses as well as reviews that do not
believe that saturated fats cause heart disease. It also states that
the saturated fats could decrease the risk of diabetes that is linked
to obesity.</p>



<p> So, while there is conflict with studies to support, dairy could be a healthy option if taken in limit. It could be helpful for people suffering from type 2 diabetes.  </p>

<p>A
new study revealed exactly how much fiber is required for keeping the
chronic conditions as well as premature mortality at bay.  The
objective of the study is to set the guideline for consumption of
fiber besides bringing to light information around the carbs
responsible for protection against non-communicable diseases as well
as curb weight gain. 
</p>



<p>The
author of the study namely Professor Jim Mann, of Otago University
New Zealand and the author of the paper Andrew Reynolds is a
postdoctoral research fellow at Otago’s Dunedin School of Medicine.

</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-Much-Fiber-Intake-For-Prevention-Of-Diseases.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1222" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-Much-Fiber-Intake-For-Prevention-Of-Diseases.jpg 678w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/How-Much-Fiber-Intake-For-Prevention-Of-Diseases-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></figure>



<p>The
study was carried out by Reynolds and colleagues by examination of a
data that had 185 observational studies that included 135 million
person-years besides 58 clinical trials that involved the
participation of 4600 people.  The study analysis was carried across
40 years. 
</p>



<p>As
per prof. Mann, the motivation behind this study was analysis of
previous reviews and meta-analysis.  The scientists studied chronic
condition incidences as well as premature deaths resulting from them.
 The conditions included cardiovascular diseases, stroke, colon
cancer, type 2 diabetes, cancers such as esophageal cancer,
endometrial cancer, prostate cancer to name a few. 
</p>



<p>The
results of the study revealed that people who consume more fiber
daily are      15-30% less prone to premature deaths or any of the
aforementioned conditions. It also determined that daily consumption
of 25 -29 gms of fibre is good for health. Though consumption of more
than 29 gms of fibre could be even more beneficial. 
</p>



<p>Having
said that, the authors cleared that the study did not present any
side effects of fibre consumption but too much fibre could also be
harmful particularly for people with iron and mineral deficiencies.
Even consumption of whole grains in excess can lead to iron
deficiency as per researchers. 
</p>



<p>Lastly,
the study also found that consumption of high amount of fibre results
does relate to less weight and cholesterol levels. 
</p>



<p> Prof. Mann says “ Health benefits of fiber are supported by over 100 years of research into its chemistry, physical properties, physiology and effects on metabolism.</p>

<p>A
study around post-menopausal women published in the journal Frontiers
in Endocrinology reveals that physical activity that involves sports
in leisure time helps in managing the blood lipid profile well, thus
reducing cardiovascular conditions as blood lipid profile is a market
of heart conditions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sports-Hobbies-For-Middle-Aged-Women-–-Benefits.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1214" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sports-Hobbies-For-Middle-Aged-Women-–-Benefits.png 620w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sports-Hobbies-For-Middle-Aged-Women-–-Benefits-300x179.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></figure>



<p> As per Karvinen and his team, after menopause the risk of <a href="https://hospital.rrmch.org/department/cardiology/">cardiovascular</a> conditions increases significantly in women and lipid profile is a reliable marker to measure heart health.  He and his colleagues investigated around 193 menopausal women participants of the age group 47-55 from Finland, registered for the Estrogenic Regulation of Muscle Apoptosis (ERMA) study.  The study is co-authored by Dr Mathew Jergenson of Minnesota Medical School and University in Minneapolis. The reason behind conducting the study as per him was to explore if physical activity did have a role in cardiovascular risk factors.  </p>



<p>
He says “It is well known that physical activity has health
benefits, yet it is less clear to what extent physical activity
prevents negative changes in lipid profile while women are in their
menopausal transition.  The participants were monitored for physical
activity levels in leisure time, generally and specifically also,
using accelerometers and had to answer questions as well.</p>



<p>
Leisure is the time that is not related to routine daily work be it
housework or commuting and includes sport or recreation activities in
free time. 
</p>



<p>The
researchers found out that there was indeed a connection between more
activities during leisure time and lowering of cholesterol levels
particularly (LDL) as well as with high levels of cholesterol (HDL). 
Karvin reports that indeed the leisure time physical activities were
related to healthy lipid profiles. But, that does not mean that the
negative changes in lipid profile during menopause can be fully done
away with due to leisure time sports activities. 
</p>



<p>The author also said that leisure time physical activities will underscore the adverse atherogenic changes in the cardiovascular risk factors in middle aged women who are healthy. Hence, sport related activities in leisure are good.  </p>
