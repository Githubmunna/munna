								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Current Concepts of infections in Orthopedics:</h1>
<p>The first RATS conference was held in 2014, the chosen theme was management of meta-diaphyseal fractures. This year, the chosen theme of the conference was ‘current concepts of infections in orthopaedics’. Infections in any speciality have always been a dreaded nightmare, more so in <a href="http://hospital.rrmch.org/department/orthopaedics/" target="_blank">orthopaedics</a>. The management of infections in orthopaedics has been fraught with dilemmas and controversies. With this in mind we set out to bring together stalwarts in orthopaedics to address the problem of infections with a focus on current concepts.</p>
<p>There was fantastic participation with over 140 registrations from institutions all over Karnataka and this only strengthened our conviction that we not only chose a good topic but we were successful in creating a brand image of <em>Rajarajeswari Annual Trauma Symposium</em> (RATS).</p>
<p>The topics were divided into basic sciences session and moved onto management of infections in specific scenarios such as problematic non unions due to infection, spinal infections and infections following joint replacement. The basic sciences sessions dealt with operative infrastructure, assessment of surgical site infections, basics of antibiotic prophylaxis, trends in development of antibiotics and biofilm formation. All the talks were followed by lively discussions and there was a robust interaction between the faculty and delegates.</p>
<p>The talks were well received and the feedback was unanimous, that there will be ensured participation for RATS 2016!</p>
