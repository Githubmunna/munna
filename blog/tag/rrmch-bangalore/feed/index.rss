<p>Though
fruits and veggies are known to be healthy options as far as food is
concerned there are conflicting views over dairy products and even
their consumption levels on a regular basis.  Milk and milk products
in plenty are a must for kids and adolescents as milk is a rich
source of calcium.  Though milk is good, it comes under saturated
fats and hence for people on a diet skimmed milk is a better option. 
</p>



<p> As per global standards the average consumption is around 2 to 2.5 servings a day for children.  Organizations like USDA and <strong>National Institute of Health (NIH)</strong> dairy is a vital source of magnesium, phosphorous, Protein and Vitamin D. A deficiency in calcium could raise the risk of osteoporosis as bones become weak and brittle.  </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Horns-Of-The-Dilemma-–-Dairy-Good-Or-Bad-For-Health.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1225" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Horns-Of-The-Dilemma-–-Dairy-Good-Or-Bad-For-Health.jpg 512w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Horns-Of-The-Dilemma-–-Dairy-Good-Or-Bad-For-Health-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure></div>



<p>Having
said that there are conflicting views around consumption of dairy
products.  As per a systematic review as well as meta-analysis says
that increase in dairy consumption increases the risk of
osteoporosis. But, not all studies are included in the said analysis.
 
</p>



<p>Another
long term study of Sweden that included 61000 women and 45000 men
revealed a potential link between high milk consumption as well as
high rate of bone fractures.  Though a Japanese study carried out
over 94,980 people revealed that a rise in consumption of milk did
lower the mortality risk. 
</p>



<p>Even the <strong>American heart Institution (AHA)</strong> has said that saturated fats could lead to increase in cholesterol as well as heart disease. Hence, some full fat dairy products do not come in the list of heart healthy diet recommendations. Furthermore, the national lung and blood institute has advised people to limit their dairy intake and use low fat dairy in their diet.  </p>



<p>There
is an article with umpteen analyses as well as reviews that do not
believe that saturated fats cause heart disease. It also states that
the saturated fats could decrease the risk of diabetes that is linked
to obesity.</p>



<p> So, while there is conflict with studies to support, dairy could be a healthy option if taken in limit. It could be helpful for people suffering from type 2 diabetes.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As
almost 500 cases crop up in Dakshin Kannada or Mangaluru, Dengue is
back this season and with a big bang for sure in Karnataka. Already
four people have succumbed to the deadly fever that is a result of
the Aedes mosquitos. Unike malaria mosquitos, Dengue mosquitos breed
inside the house in clean water. A viral infection, Dengue is at its
peak in the monsoon season every year. The most common symptoms of
dengue include headache, swollen lymph nodes, rashes, exhaustion and
high fever. The main characteristics of dengue include high fever,
rashes and headache. 
</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DENGUE.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1163" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DENGUE.jpg 700w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DENGUE-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>



<p>The
acute phase of the fever can last upto two weeks. The more serious
and life threatening condition of Dengue is Dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF) occurring mostly in under 10 years children. This complication
can cause circulatory collapse, hemorrhage and abdominal pain. The
symptoms often occur after 3 days to 15 days of the mosquito bite.
The weather conditions also are responsible to an extent for breeding
the dengue mosquitos. Outbreaks are more common in tropical and
subtropical areas. Though the condition is not contagious, if a
mosquito bites a dengue infected, it does contract the dengue virus
too and spread it onward to other people. 
</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="http://www.rrmch.org/medical-admission-mbbs-ms-md-phd/" rel="follow"><img src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rrmch.gif" alt="rrmch" class="wp-image-1057"/></a></figure>



<p>Thus
the Aedes mosquito is considered the vector or transmitter and humans
as the source of infection. As mentioned Dengue Hemorrhagic fever or
DHF is a shock syndrome of dengue that mostly affects children under
10 years of age. DHF starts abruptly with consistent fever
accompanied with headache. Other symptoms include cough, nausea, sore
throat, and vomiting as well as abdominal pain. The shock occurs
around 2 to 6 days after the onset of symptoms with sudden collapse,
mouth blueness, weak pulse to name a few. Bleeding is also a common
possibility and DHF requires close monitoring. There is no particular
treatment and only intensive care with blood transfusion and oxygen
provision as well as immediate fluid replacement are some of the
treatments.  If proper treatment is provided the mortality rate could
be less but it could rise to as high as 20% if not treated properly. 
</p>



<p>The best idea is to take care around your house and avoid travelling to mosquito prone areas. Check for water storage possibilities for breeding mosquitos and treat appropriately.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Many of us are already aware that our most favorite and loved film actor, <strong>Amitabh Bachchan</strong>, has been living with Hepatitis B for a long time now. He has also played an active role in spreading awareness around the taboo associated with the condition. He himself is an ambassador for it and recently speaking at an awareness initiative on Hepatitis B, he spoke about how he feels disturbed hearing about women with hepatitis being thrown out of the house. He showed his willingness to fight against the condition till the end of his life. He is 76 and was addressing a meeting held during the launch of National Action plan for fighting viral hepatitis in India. <a href="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Hepatitis-B-Amitabh-Bachchan.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1093" src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Hepatitis-B-Amitabh-Bachchan.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="151" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here’s is run down the causes, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B. Even today there are thousands of cases of Hepatitis B in India, though they have been reduced significantly as compared to the last decade. Hepatitis generally occurs in the age group of 20 to 49 years. The chronic hepatitis is generally rare and is found amongst 5% to 10% of the people only. Though the carriers of Hepatitis B virus are over 1.4 million people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Hepatitis B</em> is an infection of the liver. The infection leads to scaring of the lever and at times even liver failure. The virus spreads form one person to another through blood transfusion, body fluids as well as open sores of the one suffering from Hepatitis B. Hepatitis B and C can turn out to be chronic condition while other A, C and E remain acute. Chronic Hepatitis B develops at a slow pace. It might not surface for as many as 3 months and can last from somewhere 2-12 weeks. The virus has the ability to live outside the body for a week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Risk Factors</strong><br />
The HBV infection risk include a certain group of people like Health Workers, people using IV drugs, people with multiple sex partners, kidney disease, people above 60 and having diabetes as well as people travelling to countries with high incidence for HBV infection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
Some of the symptoms of acute hepatitis B include dark urine, appetite loss, abdominal discomfort, weakness, fever and jaundice like symptoms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Diagnosis</strong><br />
The diagnosis of the condition is done mostly of the basis of blood tests after screening. The screening usually is based on risk factors mentioned above. The tests include surface antigen test that shows if the condition is contigeous, core antigen test that determines if you are infected or not, surface anti body test and liver function test to name a few.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Treatment</strong><br />
To prevent Hepatitis B, you need to get yourself vaccinated and if you are exposed to the virus get in touch with the doctor within 24 hours. Acute hepatitis does not need treatment and is healed by itself. Though it is advisable that the person does take rest and remains hydrated. Chronic Hepatitis B is treated with antiviral medications which help you combat the virus and avoid the risk of future liver complications.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chronic Kidney disease or CKD is s result of loss of kidney function over a period of time. Practically, the kidneys fail, if you may say so. There are though, five stages of CKD depending upon the severity. When the kidneys fail the waste, water and toxic substances accumulate in the body because the kidneys are not able to excrete them. This can further result in conditions like acidosis (excessive acidity of body fluids), disorders related to fatty acids and cholesterol, anemia and high blood pressure.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chronic-Kidney-Disease-1-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-828 size-large" src="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chronic-Kidney-Disease-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Chronic Kidney Disease" width="615" height="345" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chronic-Kidney-Disease-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chronic-Kidney-Disease-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chronic-Kidney-Disease-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chronic-Kidney-Disease-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></a></p>
<p>While Stage five is obviously the end stage known as kidney or renal failure which results in complete kidney function failure. At this stage the person needs dialysis to survive or kidney transplantation.<br />
Acute kidney failure can also lead to loss of kidney function but it’s faster over a period of few days or weeks. But, this condition is reversible many times and there is a possibility of complete recovery of kidney function. But sometimes, it could end up as irreversible and require dialysis.</p>
<p><strong>STAGES</strong><br />
Here’s a run-down the stages of chronic kidney diseases.<br />
1. Slight damage with normal or increased filtration      GFR &gt; 90<br />
2. Mild decrease in kidney function                                GFR range 60-90<br />
3. Moderate decrease in kidney function                       GFR range 30 -59<br />
4. Severe decrease in kidney function                           GFR range 15-29<br />
5. Kidney Failure                                                            GFR &lt;15 / Dialysis</p>
<p><strong>DIAGNOSIS</strong><br />
To check for kidney damage, you need to undergo a few tests that include checking the level of waste products like creatinine and urea, in blood and urine test for abnormalities that indicate kidney damage cause. You may have to undergo an ultrasound for kidney structure assessment and biopsy for determining the cause of kidney problem. The diagnosis is based on results of Glomerular filtration rate and includes details like patient’s age, gender, race and serum creatinine levels.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="best kidney hospitals in bangalore" href="https://hospital.rrmch.org/department/urology/" target="_blank"><strong>BEST KIDNEY HOSPITALS IN BANGALORE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>RISK FACTORS</strong><br />
Some of the common risk factors of Chronic kidney disease include smoking, hypertension, obesity and diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p><strong>TREATMENT</strong><br />
After course of treatment is decided after determining the cause of the disease. Some kidney complications are treatable while some are not. The treatment procedure includes controlling the symptoms, reducing the complications and slowing the progression process through tested methods. In case the kidneys are severely damage then end stage treatment is provided. The medications used include those for reducing cholesterol levels, treating anemia and high blood pressure, reducing the swelling and protecting your bones. You might also be required to go on low protein diet to minimize wastage in blood.</p>
<p><strong>END STAGE TREAMENT</strong><br />
If your kidneys fail then the only treatment options available are dialysis or transplant. Dialysis is the process of removal of waste products from the body artificially with the help of a machine viz hemodialysis or a thin tube (catheter) fitted in the abdomen and dialysis solution that absorbs the waste plus excess fluids and is drained out. viz peritoneal dialysis. Kidney transplant on the other side is an expensive but better procedure because it involves replacing your kidney with a healthy kidney of a donor surgically. It could be of a deceased or living person. Though, medications after the procedure are to be taken life long for your body to accept the organ through life but no dialysis.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">Ramadevi Nimmanapalli, a cancer researcher by profession had been in the US till 2015. She returned to India leaving behind this career in order to take up another challenging opportunity of setting up a faculty of Veterinary and Animal Sciences at the Benaras Hindu University in Varanasi. She herself had done her Science Graduation from Sri Venkateswara Veterinary University in Hyderabad after which she did her Masters in Sciences, topping the University. She further went to Oxford to pursue PhD there.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cancer-to-Curd-1-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-822" src="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cancer-to-Curd-1-1.jpg" alt="Cancer to Curd" width="600" height="381" /></a></p>
<p align="justify">Describing her experience in Oxford England as a rather challenging one even though she was a topper, she mentioned that the education system in India and England was different. Catching up was quite a task because Indian education courses do not offer in-depth study as compared to Oxford. So, she had to work really hard with her research in microbiology in bluetongue virus that affects deers and cattle as well. After completing her Phd. She shifted to USA where she researched in areas of human cancer and chemical pathways for drug Gleevac. Before returning to India she was teaching at the Philadelphia college of Osteopathic Medicine and MD Anderson Cancer centre, Tuskagee University.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="justify"><a title="Best Cancer Hospitals in Bangalore" href="https://hospital.rrmch.org/department/surgical-oncology/" target="_blank"><strong>BEST CANCER HOSPITAL IN BANGALORE</strong></a></p>
<p align="justify">Though shifting to India was also not an easy decision for her as she was already married and living there with her husband, it’s when her husband supported the decision to take the decision to go to Indi without him joining her right away, after she moved here.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, in India, as the Dean at the Benaras University, she is all set to revive the faculty which already has a dairy farm on its main campus besides a research ready campus that is being setup in Mirzapur for MSc and Doctoral students, which is nearby. She is working hard to set up this new faculty and her straight forward attitude which she brought along as a learning from her USA lifestyle has been of a great aid. She has already published around 40 research papers but the one that stands out is about dealing and characterization of curd or dahi. Though the founding dean of the faculty has not had any admissions, later this year, the faculty is going to welcome its first batch of undergraduate students. The team is ready, the labs are set and the preparations are on to take the plunge. Though a lot of preparations are underway as well, as per the Dean, it’s a long way to go.</p>
