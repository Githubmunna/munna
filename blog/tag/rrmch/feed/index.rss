								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">As women age and surpass the middle age milestone called 40, even though age is just a number, practically the body does have to deal with certain issues that crop up as we enter this phase. So what can you do to keep your health in optimal condition? Here are few tips that might just help you out.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Health First</strong> – Many a times while keeping the family needs as a priority women forget to check on their health issues or ignore It most of the times. One needs to understand that only when one is healthy then only can they take care of their loved ones.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Health-Tips-For-Women-Above-40-1-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-847" src="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Health-Tips-For-Women-Above-40-1-1.jpg" alt="Health Tips For Women Above 40" width="702" height="336" /></a></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Body Check</strong> – If you haven’t done a <a title="Health Checkup packages in Bangalore" href="https://hospital.rrmch.org/patientsvisitors/health-checkups/" target="_blank">medical checkup its time</a>. Once you hit 40 do it once every two to three years. Check for deficiencies in your body particularly Calcium, Vitamin D and B12. Vitamin D and Calcium are needed for strong bones and in your 40’s you require 1000mg of calcium and 400 to 800 UI of vitamin D every single day so either you have to switch to that sort of diet or go for supplements. The checks you need at this age include eye testing, BP test, Mole check, Mammogram, Glucose test Pap and pelvic test as well as thyroid. All these need to be done every 2 – 3 years approximately.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Exercise</strong> – Exercise is good for all but more so once you turn 40. You are aging and you need to exercise to stay fit. Kick start your day with strength training and see the change within 6 months. Just dedicate 30 minutes a day to it.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Diet Check</strong> – It’s time you revamp your diet and go for a balanced one which will help you cope with your deficiencies and keep your cholesterol levels under check. Having breakfast daily can help greatly against skipping it. A study reveals that over a period of time people who take good breakfast lose more weight than the ones who make breakfast their smallest meal. Get in a lot of protein as they are mood boosters and help you relieve yourself from poor memory, excessive thinking or depression.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Get good Sleep</strong> – Sleeping helps you reduce stress and hence a good sleep is important. Particularly women don’t care about it much and it ultimately takes a toll on their health. Also try to control your stress through meditation and yoga. This will help you stay fit physically and mentally.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Spend time with Girl Friends</strong> – Ya, you might be busy to the core but take out time to hangout with your girl buddies because it is found that women with socialization or hobby activities have less risk of heart disease or less blood pressure and diabetes issues.</p>
<p align="justify"><a title="Medical Colleges in Bangalore" href="http://www.rrmch.org/" target="_blank">RRMCH</a> has got the <a title="Master Health Checkup in Bangalore" href="https://hospital.rrmch.org/patientsvisitors/health-checkups/" target="_blank">best health checkup packages in Bangalore</a>.

<p>We celebrated ORS day on 29 July 2017, programme was conducted in our OPD and pediatric wards to highlight the importance of Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) and its significance in the treatment of dehydration.</p>
<p>Excessive loss of fluids and electrolytes in the body causes dehydration. Conditions like vomiting, diarrhea, and diseases which cause diarrhea such as bacterial or viral infection, cholera, food poisoning, unhygienic feeding practices can increase the chances of dehydration.</p>
<p>Dr. Adarsh, Prof and HOD had inaugurated the programme. We created the awareness programme in parents and distributed the ORS to the children.</p>
<p>This programme helped the parents to know more about dehydration difficulties and how to prevent the problem.</p>
<p>We gave a demo on How to make the ORS drink which is available in powder form?</p>
<p>1.Put the contents of the ORS packet in a clean container. Check the packet for directions and add the amount of clean water as indicated. Too little water could make the diarrhea worse.</p>
<p>2.Add water only. Do not add ORS to milk, soup, fruit juice or any soft drinks. Do not add sugar.</p>
<p>3.Stir well, and feed it to the child from a clean cup. Do not use a bottle.</p>
<h4>ORS Day</h4>
<p>ORS Day is celebrated every year on 29th July to highlight the importance of Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) as a cost-effective method of health intervention. Acute diarrhoeal diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality in infants and young children in many developing countries. According to WHO, Diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under five years old. Diarrhoea, which is frequently caused by poor sanitation and hygiene, can have serious, even deadly results, typically as a result of diarrhoea-related dehydration. It particularly affects infants, children and old people. Diarrhoea generally lasts for several days, and leaves the body without water and salts that are necessary for survival. Most people who die from diarrhoea actually die from severe dehydration and fluid loss from the body.</p>
<p>Dehydration from diarrhoea can be prevented by giving extra fluids at home, or it can be treated simply and effectively by giving adequate glucose-electrolyte solution called<strong> Oral Rehydration Salts</strong> (ORS) solution. ORS Jodi (ORS and Zinc) has proven to be successful in the prevention and management of acute diarrhoea and dehydration. Oral rehydration salts contain a variety of salts (electrolytes) and sugar. The combination of electrolytes and sugar stimulates water and electrolyte absorption from the gut. It therefore prevents or reverses dehydration and replaces lost salts in conditions such as diarrhoea and vomiting.ORS is available in the market in a powder form in sachets/ readymade solutions or one can also easily make it at home as well.</p>
<p><b>All we need to know:</b><br />
How to make the ORS drink which is available in powder form?</p>
<p>4.Put the contents of the ORS packet in a clean container. Check the packet for directions and add the amount of clean water as indicated. Too little water could make the diarrhea worse.</p>
<p>5.Add water only. Do not add ORS to milk, soup, fruit juice or any soft drinks. Do not add sugar.</p>
<p>6.Stir well, and feed it to the child from a clean cup. Do not use a bottle.</p>
<p>World Breastfeeding Week is an annual celebration which is being held every year from 1to 7 August in many countries all over the world and since past three years ADK Hospital has continued the celebration of this week. World Breastfeeding week is celebrated with the goal to promote exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life which gives tremendous benefits to baby as well as to the mother.</p>
<p>The<strong> World Health Organization</strong> (WHO), <strong>American Academy of Pediatrics</strong> (AAP) and the <strong>World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action</strong> (WABA) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and then supplemented breastfeeding up to two years or more.</p>
<p>Theme for World Breastfeeding Week 2016 is “A Key to Sustainable Development”, which is focusing on the importance of breastfeeding and promote breastfeeding as key element in getting us to think about how to value our wellbeing from the start of life, how to respect each other and care for the world we share.</p>

To commemorate the opening of this centre, Department of Pediatrics, RRMCH, has organized a CME on changing diabetes in children helping all doctors understand the detailed and latest management of such children. Also an elaborate nutritional exhibition which throws much light and knowledge on nutritional aspects of TIDM including carbohydrate counts and glycemic index which is apt for today’s modern children’s lifestyle was displayed. This impacted practical knowledge of eating the right food. During CME our chairman <strong><a title="Sri A.C.Shanmugam B.A LLB" href="http://www.rrmch.org/chairman/the-hindu-group-felicitation-to-dr-a-c-shanmugham/" target="_blank">Sri A.C.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">Dandruff is a common condition amongst us and yes it is a headache of sorts when its about dealing with this devil of a kind called dandruff. Primarily, it keeps coming back and secondarily it many times becomes difficult find an ultimate solution to the problem, causing headache. So, let us discuss out a reliable solution that can really cure our headache of dandruff and help us manage it well.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Dandruff or Flaky Scalp</strong> – Now, many of us are not able to figure out what we have actually got on our heads, is it dandruff or a flaky scalp. Dandruff occurs after an overreaction of yeast resulting into excess production of oil. As a result you experience irritation and get visible waxy and oily flakes. Besides, even skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis can also cause flaky scalps. Everyday stress, aging and an improper diet is also responsible for flakiness in the scalp.</p>
<p align="justify">Actually, to figure out how do deal with dandruff or a flaky scalp you need to visit a dermatologist first and get diagnosed. The remedies would depend on the condition and the severity. Here are some tips on getting rid of flakiness in scalp.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">Before we talk about risk factors associated with dementia lets just polish our information around the condition. This condition usually occurs at an older age and causes memory loss. Alzheimers is one of the most common forms of dementia known. Apparently, its not a condition by a symptoms or group of symptoms rather. You should also know that it does hamper our day to day routines because we tend to forget a lot. Dementia symptoms are also caused due to vitamin deficiencies and thyroid problems. Dementia occurs due to brain cell damage and most of them are generally permanent or increase with time.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Dementia-Risk-and-Blood-Magnesium-Levels-1-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-711" src="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Dementia-Risk-and-Blood-Magnesium-Levels-1-1.jpg" alt="Dementia Risk and Blood Magnesium Levels" width="600" height="320" /></a></p>
<p align="justify">Now, a study has found out that the levels of magnesium in your blood can associated to the risk of dementia later in life. The people with lower or higher levels of minerals in the body were subject to dementia more compared to the ones with middle levels. It has yet to be proved and nowhere confirm that it causes dementia but definitely magnesium levels do have a link with dementia. There are apparently two ways in which magnesium levels could be called as risk factor for dementia.</p>
<p align="justify">Coming back to the study, around 10,000 participant around 65 years of age were studied across 8 years span and their magnesium levels were checked at the beginning of the test. They were divided in 5 groups. The study findings showed that those with low and high level magnesium had 30% greater risk of dementia compared to mid level magnesium level participants. The lower and higher magnesium range is below 0.85 millimoles per liter and 1.10 mmol/L respectively. Though as the magnesium levels were not measure post eight years the results could have associated limitations.</p>
<p align="justify">Well, to prove that magnesium levels do determine the risk of dementia in later stages of life, further detailed study is required.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">There is certainly a relation between yeasts and diabetes and most logically it is sugar that relates yeast infections to diabetes. Yeast are generally found growing near mucous membranes around the skin. When there is a build up of yeast, it is called yeast infection. As yeast feeds on sugar and diabetics tend to sweat, pee and secrete a lot of mucus due to high glucose levels, automatically inviting yeasts to build on and cause yeast infections. The areas where yeast grow rapidly are those with warm temperatures typically under skin folds and breasts, mouth and around genitals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Diabetes-and-Yeast-Infections-1-1.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-650 size-medium" src="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Diabetes-and-Yeast-Infections-1-300x157.jpg" alt="Diabetes and Yeast Infections" width="300" height="157" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most common of the yeast infections with women is the vaginal infection and generally occurs in people suffering from diabetics that is not under proper control. When the diabetes is not controlled properly, it also effects the immune system adversely. Apparently, it suppresses the growth of immune proteins known as beta defensins, responsible for killing microbes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, even after treatment, there is high possibility of re-occurrence of the infection in people with poorly controlled diabetes. This is because after colonization of the yeast in a particular area, its becomes easy for yeast to re-attack. The extra sugar levels in diabetics helps in colonization on the yeast and makes it easy for other pathogens to stick to mucous gland and skin cells as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Diagnosis</strong><br />
The doctor asks for vaginal secretion sample test to confirm the vaginal yeast infection. The microscopical review of the sample is carried out for confirmation of Candida fungus in abnormal amounts. Sometimes even urine samples are tested.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Treatment</strong><br />
Most of the doctors prescribe anti-fungal creams that can be easily applied to the affected area. These creams are usually available over the counter. Only when creams aren’t effective is when doctors prescribe a dose of anti-fungal medication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Home Remedies</strong><br />
Alternatively, home remedies like using oregano oil, yogurt, over the counter creams, coconut or tea tree oil for treating yeast infection are commonly tried.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Prevention</strong><br />
Prevention is always a better idea, and particularly for diabetics, wherein there is high possibility of yeast infection to reoccur. But, certain precautionary measures can help you keep the yeast infection at bay. This includes keeping body and genital dry, using clean cotton under garments and perfumed pads of good quality. As far as diet supplements are concerned, eating yogurt on a daily basis helps a lot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though, treating the root cause would definitely help you the most so try keeping your glucose levels under control to prevent the complications that arise due to the same.</p>

		<title>A NEW DISCOVERY ABOUT LUNG FUNCTIONING</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">It has been known that Lungs are involved in facilitating respiration but a recent study on mice has discovered that they play a far more complex role in bodies of mammals. This role involves production of 10 million platelets or tiny blood cells every hour, which is equal to the platelets majority in animal circulation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/LUNG-FUNCTIONING-1-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-640" src="http://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/LUNG-FUNCTIONING-1-1.jpg" alt="LUNG FUNCTIONING" width="600" height="320" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">The researchers in California University also found out that the blood stem cells in the lung tissue responsible for the same were wrongly presumed to be located inside the bone marrow. This only proves the significance of the lungs and that their role isn’t restricted only to respiration and play an important role in blood formation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier, it was assumed that the majority of the cells responsible for blood production belong inside the bone marrow but contradicting the earlier research findings, the news ones show that most of the platelet forming cells known as the mega karyoctes function from inside the lung tissue and more importantly are responsible of production of majority of the body’s platelets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, earlier the researchers did not have the technology but with the advent of two photon intra-vital imaging that involves the process of insertion of a substance known as green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the genome of the mouse. After the insertion, the platelets strated emitting bright green fluorescence while moving around the body in real time. This helped the team determine their movement path, which wasn’t possible earlier. This is when it was revealed that most of the platelets population resided inside the lung tissue and produced megakaryocytes. Also, the production was found to be around 10 million platelets per hour in mice lungs. This automatically proves that almost half of the platelet production was carried out inside the lungs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though, the fascinating part about the discovery is that the mega karyoctes originate in the bone marrow, then travel to the lungs and then start producing platelets. Though, a human replication is yet to be done, none the less it makes a strong case for the functioning of the lungs.</p>
