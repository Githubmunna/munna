<p>We
are aware how dangerous smoking is for health, but second hand smoke
viz. the smoke that we inhale when someone else is smoking could be
life threatening too. As per statistics second hand smoke is known to
cause over 3000 deaths due to heart disease to non-smokers.

<p>Second
hand smoke can be particularly harmful to children because their
lungs are still under development.   Many children inhale this
dangerous smoke at home if their parents or family members smoke,
primarily. Even parents who smoke outside risk their children to
harmful chemicals because of second hand smoke. 
</p>



<p>Also,
known as environmental tobacco smoke, the smoke that is breathed out
as well as the smoke that is released from pipes, cigars, burning
cigarettes, cigars or pipes contains around 4000 chemicals. Almost 50
of these chemicals are carcinogenic and are known to increase the
risk of cancer. 
</p>



<p>The
American Academy of pediatrics (AAP) did a research on third hand
smoke also. Third hand smoke is the smoke that is left behind in
areas where people smoke. Though people leave the place after
smoking, the harmful toxins remain for a while for example in bars,
upholstery, even childâ€™s hair if the care taker smokes. 
</p>



<p>Well,
second hand smoke and third hand smoke both are harmful to adults,
children and even the unborn developing ones. Unborn and children are
at a higher risk. Children whose parents smoke cough more than
children generally do. They are at the risk of getting coughs and
colds, tooth decay, ear infections and respiratory problems. Children
suffering from asthma are particularly prone to second hand smoke as
it can lead to asthma attacks that to frequent and severe leading to
a rise in hospital visits. 
</p>



<p>Well, so if you think that only smoking is injuries to health, you are certainly not right, its also the people around the smokers that are at the risk inspite of being not guilty of smoking. Take care. Quit now.</p>
