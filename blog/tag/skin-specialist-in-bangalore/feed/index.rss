								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Sunscreens are a common household commodity today in India. With temperatures in India soaring across its length and breadth during summers and generally across the year in most of the regions, sunscreen is generally used by many of us for protection against the scorching sun.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But, like every coin has two sides to it, even sunscreens come with their share of pros and cons. So, let us run down the brighter side of the product and the flip side as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SUNSCREEN USES</strong><br />
They help protect the skin from sun, control aging and prevent sunburns. They also decrease the risk of cancers and reactions caused due to certain medications. The protective layer formed with sunscreens absorbs or reflects the radiations and does not allow them to penetrate deep inside the skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though, for optimum effect sunscreens need to be applied properly. In general, 30 grams of cream is enough for covering the entire body. The cream needs to be applied 30 minutes before exposure to sun and needs to be reapplied every 2 hours. Sunscreens can used for people of 1 year and above and is not recommended for infants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SUNSCREEN SIDE EFFECTS</strong><br />
<em>Vitamin D Deficiency</em> &#8211; A recent study has found that use of sunscreens on a regular basis leads to deficiency of vitamin D. The people who use highly protective sunscreens are more liable to develop deficiency of vitamin D. Already, people spend most of their time indoors than outdoors and now the sunscreen when outdoors, so its about zeros the <a title="Vitamin D" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D" target="_blank">Vitamin D</a> availability to the body almost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, Sunscreens can also cause side effects such as redness of skin, skin irritation and also increase the risk of breast cancer with one of its chemicals does effect the blood estrogen levels. It can also cause red spots or red itchy rashes on skin besides eye irritation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having said that, it does not mean that we stop using sunscreen. But, moderate exposures to sun is a good idea while using sun screens to protect skin from harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun that may cause skin cancer.</p>
