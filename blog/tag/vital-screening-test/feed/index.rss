								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">In the times when pesticides and carcinogenic stuff has become a daily part of our life and is laying the path for different types of cancers, preventive screenings can help a lot in catching cancer in time and improving the quality of life.</p>
<p align="justify">Today people are very much aware about preventive screenings at an early age but due to lack of time and hectic work schedules and other priorities you tend to ignore a few. Definitely, people are taking cancer screenings seriously.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Vital-Screening-Test.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1111" src="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Vital-Screening-Test.jpg" alt="Vital Screening Test" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Vital-Screening-Test.jpg 600w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Vital-Screening-Test-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Vital-Screening-Test-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.rrmch.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Vital-Screening-Test-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p align="justify">One such condition is Osteoporosis. In this condition the body loses a lot of bone and makes very less or sometimes it could be both together. In Osteoporosis, bones become brittle. They could break even if there is a simple fall or at times even due to sneezing.</p>
<p align="justify">As per health experts early detection and intervention can help you curb the progression of the condition with the help of medicines as well as required life style changes. To detect osteoporosis, you need to go through the bone mineral density (BMD) test.</p>
<p align="justify">The diagnosis can help you detect the condition, the risk factors as well as the tracking over the course of your treatment. The test that is commonly taken and is painless in nature is the Central DXA test or the Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry test similar to X-ray. This test is recommended for the 65 and above women. As of now age based recommendations are not there for men. As per the NIH below 65 women who are at the risk of fracture also need to get tested.</p>
<p align="justify">Risk factors include low body weight, genes, early menopause, addictions like smoking and rheumatoid arthritis disorder. People with family history of osteoporosis are at the risk of getting it early on in their 40â€™s. So, thinking that osteoporosis can only occur post 65 years is not apparently true.</p>
<p align="justify">Well, get a little more aware and serious around some conditions that might not be life threatening but still vital because it could affect quality of life by getting you into painful problems.</p>
