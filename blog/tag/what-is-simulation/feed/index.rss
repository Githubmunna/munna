								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is Simulation?</h2>
<p>Simulation is a technique to replace or amplify real-patient experiences with guided experiences. Various types of simulators are used to train and assess different levels of learners. These include mannequin simulators, human cadaver or animal models, computer-based simulation, haptic and/or virtual simulation, as well as simulation using standardized patients. Simulation has been an accepted part of training, assessment and research in high-reliability organizations, such as aviation, nuclear power, and military. Healthcare has adopted simulation from these fields for the purpose of training healthcare providers. Simulation-based learning has been used to shorten the gap that exists between the learning environment and the real clinical environment. Many skill trainers have been developed to actualize real clinical site especially for novice residents .</p>
<p align="justify">Utilization of simulatiors has many advantages for medical education:<br />
1) learning can be focused on the level of trainees with various levels of difficulties;<br />
2) learners can either learn the whole procedure process or just focus on certain tasks of the procedure;<br />
3) learners have the opportunity to repetitively practice in quick succession;<br />
4) learners learn in a safe environment where they can be allowed to learn from their mistakes rather than be rescued by their supervisor to keep the patient safe;<br />
5) simulators can provide objective evidence of performance, offering potential for their use for assessment, both formative and summative;<br />
6) simulation can provide practice on certain procedures such as cricothyrotomy, which is a critical life-saving procedure that is uncommon and rarely performed by residents.</p>
<p align="justify">Simulation has a potential to promote a new paradigm compared to traditional education tools. Technical skills and non-technical skills can be taught to residents via a standardized and organized simulation program teams.</p>
